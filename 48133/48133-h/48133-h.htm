    <div>TO ALEXANDER TEIXEIRA DE MATTOS</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>You, who have read the three volumes of <cite>The Sensationalists</cite>
in manuscript, place me under further obligation by
allowing me to dedicate the third to you in commemoration
of a friendship which has been long, intimate and—to me—unmatched.
Though I acquit you of responsibility for
shortcomings in anything that I have written, the tale of
these shortcomings would have been far longer if I had
not availed myself of your unfailing vigilance and ever-ready
help, as I have profited by your sensitive criticism
and sympathetic encouragement.</p>

<p class='c009'>The novel-trilogy is so little acclimatized to latter-day
Georgian England that, though it may need no defence,
it has provoked attacks from readers who will suffer all
artistic forms but those which are offered to the public in
his present majesty’s reign; I say no more in its apology
than that it provides a convenient medium for a study in
which the story-teller occupies, in succession, three different
standpoints. In <cite>Lady Lilith</cite>, the emotion hunters and
sensation-mongers who supply the drama of this trilogy are still
practising their poses in mirrored and passionless detachment;
in <cite>The Education of Eric Lane</cite>, artifice has grown to
such strength that, in its contest with reality, the battle—between
antagonists no longer detached nor passionless—stands
drawn; in <cite>The Secret Victory</cite>, a close contact with
reality deflates the tumid pretensions of artifice and forces
an amateur company of tragi-comedians into the revealing
daylight of the open street. Even if it had been possible
to present these three phases in a single volume, I should
have been sorry to lose the interval which bridged the
transition from one phase to another.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='viii' id='Page_viii'></span>Whether a study of flamboyantly conscious egotism deserves
three volumes can hardly be decided impartially by
one who has attempted the study; but the novelist has at no
time been more insistently urged to contemplate unabashed
egotism than in an age when the camera and the printing-press,
the public confession and the private conversation,
the conclusions of psychology and the phantasies of psycho-analysis
combine forces to further the cult of personality.
“Ninety-five per cent. of the human race,” said Mr. Cutler
Walpole in <cite>The Doctor’s Dilemma</cite>, “suffer from chronic
blood-poisoning, and die of it. It’s as simple as A. B. C.
Your nuciform sac is full of decaying matter....” Ninety-five
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per centum</span></i> would seem a modest estimate for the proportion
of the human race which, in one social division of
England at the present time, is dying spiritually of acute
egomania.</p>

<p class='c009'>In reading the manuscript of this trilogy you encountered
characters whom you had met in earlier novels; if at some
future time you have the patience to read those later novels
which have been executed, or at least planned, but not yet
published, you are more than likely to meet some of them
again. The practice of carrying certain characters from one
book to another is hardly so much an arrogant assumption
that the public has made their acquaintance in a former
presentation as an effort to give additional verisimilitude to
a picture which is being built up in sections: an academic history
of the years before the war, of the war itself and of
the years following it would inevitably introduce, in volume
after volume, some at least of the same warriors, statesmen,
financiers and social leaders; if, in an imaginary picture
of the same period, the novelist offends by following
the same method, he offends in the consoling company of
Balzac, Disraeli and Thackeray among the dead and of
Galsworthy and Mackenzie among the living.</p>

<p class='c009'>To you I need offer no excuse for having hitherto confined
myself for the most part to men and women whose means
and leisure enable them to be occupied with public affairs
or preoccupied with private introspection: as human beings,
<span class='pageno' title='ix' id='Page_ix'></span>susceptible to pain and pleasure, they are not less interesting
than those who devote a greater proportion of their time to
the struggle for existence; in the opinion of some, they may
win an added interest by the larger air of a more spacious
life and by the subtile discrimination of wider intellectual
sympathies; if a novelist offends by neglecting the narrow
streets and sunless cottages of this era, he offends once more
in the company of Disraeli and Thackeray.</p>

<p class='c009'>The present volume of <cite>The Sensationalists</cite> brings the
trilogy to an end; the reception accorded to the first volumes
was too evenly mixed to indicate how the third will be
greeted; but, since all three books were planned and completed
as one whole before the first was published, it is as one
whole that I should like them to be judged. Jointly and
severally, however, their fate is of less importance to me
than the pleasure which I derived from writing them; and,
in the present volume, no words give me greater pleasure
than those on the dedication page.</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Roused</span> by a report of peace hardly less deafening than
the crash of war four and a half years earlier, the winter
garden of the Majestic hummed like a vast and airless beehive.
On the long sofas by the walls, in deferential clusters
round some slow-voiced, arm-chair oracle and in wavering
groups at one moment distinct and at another herded together,
everybody who could find room between the crowded
tables and the obtrusive palm-tubs eagerly volleyed question
and answer, contributing his pennyworth of gossip and retiring
with his pound of rumour.</p>

<p class='c009'>No one in New York had seriously doubted that Germany
would accept the armistice terms; but, until they were signed,
the talk of private dinners and public celebrations remained
half-hearted. Now that the invitations had been discharged,
no one knew what to do next. One group of lean, sagacious
officers debated how soon they would be demobilized and restored
to their businesses; a harassed parliament of women
exchanged acid confidences about the apartments which they
had taken when their husbands came to New York for the
war; a second and a younger group of officers deplored the
<span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span>untimely cessation of hostilities before they had seen any
fighting.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘All-dressed-up-and-nowhere-to-go,’” hummed one.
“Why, Carstairs, when did <em>you</em> get here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He shook hands with an agitated young Englishman who
was peering over the heads and under the arms of his neighbours.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hullo, Long! I left Washington last night. You’ve
not seen my wife, have you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lady John was over by the far door a while back. I’ll
shew you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He took Carstairs by the arm and dragged him through
the crowd to a corner where a young woman had entrenched
herself behind a row of palm-tubs and a breastwork of wicker
chairs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Much obliged. I say, what about a drink? Oh, of
course, you’re not allowed to. Never mind, there’s a good
time ahead of you as soon as you’re out of uniform. By
the way, we’re coming to your dinner. Very good of you
to ask us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The officer bowed and went back to his own group. Carstairs
dropped limply into a chair and rang a bell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“God, what a mob! And what a day! I haven’t had a
moment to myself. The horrors of peace!”</p>

<p class='c009'>His wife pressed his hand sympathetically, and the gold of
a new wedding-ring caught and flung back the light from the
great arc-lamps.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Could you do anything about our passages?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I wandered into the chancery and got them to make
up a bag. After that there was no difficulty, but the boat
will be ankle-deep in Ministry of Munitions people and
Treasury people and Propaganda people. There are more
English officials than Americans in New York to-day.
Precious glad every one will be to get rid of us! By the
way, Sadler Long wants to give us a farewell dinner at the
<span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'></span>Biltmore; I said you weren’t doing anything. Was that all
right?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is it to-night?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No. We’re dining with Grant to-night at the Plaza.
It’s a farewell dinner to Eric Lane, the dramatist fellow.
The great American people will be both tired and dyspeptic
by the time it’s given a farewell dinner to every munition-contractor,
exchange-stabilizer and itinerant lecturer in the
country.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I want to meet Mr. Lane,” said Lady John.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, you’ll have every opportunity on the boat. I can’t
say <em>I</em> do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A waiter came to their table with two cocktails. Carstairs
signed for them, lighted a cigarette and leaned back
with one leg thrown over the other. On the far side of the
serried palm-tubs and wicker chairs, an English voice said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Waiter! I ordered a Number Twenty-Three.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Number Twenty-Three,” repeated the waiter, turning his
head for an instant in full flight.</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric Lane nodded and pretended to read his paper, refusing
to be driven from a comfortable chair because a
strange Englishman, with the notorious tact of the English,
chose to discuss him by name at two yards’ distance. Until
three minutes before, he had been agreeably lulled by the high
hum of American voices; but this drawling English, with a
hint of impatient superiority in it, assailed and defeated him.
He was also humanly curious to know what the strange
Englishman had heard or thought about him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I like his plays,” said Lady John. “Is there anything
against him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lane decided that she must be a New Englander. Then
he recalled his glimpse of the underhung, impatient Englishman
and remembered that Frances Naylor of Boston had
married Lord John Carstairs six months earlier. The match
had caused nearly a week’s excitement, for Carstairs was
<span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span>brother and heir-presumptive to the imbecile Duke of Ross,
while Frances Naylor was a future heiress and a present
beauty.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I’ve no objection to him personally,” said Carstairs.
“But I don’t suppose we’re very popular with him as a
family. There was a blighted romance between him and my
cousin, Barbara Neave.” He laughed, and Eric Lane felt
his cheeks warming. “I’m afraid you’ll find Barbara—and
her relicts and reputation—rather a mouthful.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Not for the first time Frances Carstairs wished that the
English had fewer relations. She had been bewilderingly
initiated into the complex family tangle of the Neaves and
Lorings, the Carstairs and Knightriders; John had drawn
her ingenious plans to shew who had married whom, but
every new name impaled her on a new genealogical tree, so
that she openly dreaded her arrival in England and the
threatened tour of inspection among her husband’s manifold
connections.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I thought you told me your cousin had married
recently,” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, she married George Oakleigh. He was a son of
Miles Oakleigh, the head of the family; and his cousin,
Violet Hunter-Oakleigh, who’s of the Catholic branch in the
county Dublin, married <em>my</em> cousin, Jim Loring, who was
killed in ’15. I know it’s confusing at first——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s maddening! What has all this to do with Mr.
Lane? If your cousin—our cousin——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, <em>that’s</em> all over, but he may feel she made rather a fool
of him. However, he’s in good company: when she was
seventeen, I was supposed to be engaged to her, and Crawleigh
had to contradict it in the press; and, to my knowledge,
she’s been married off to six people in as many years, beginning
with one of the young princes and ending with
some barrister. She’s all right if you don’t take her seriously,
but I’m told that Lane <em>did</em>, rather. She tried to drive
<span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'></span>him in double harness with the barrister until they both
bolted in opposite directions; then Lane came out here, and
the other man, Waring, quietly retired to the country; then
she married George Oakleigh. And that’s the end of Barbara.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lady John felt that a criticism was expected of her, but
could not decide how far it was safe to disapprove of her
celebrated new cousin without incurring a charge of provincialism.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, she had her fair share of romance,” she ventured
after a pause. “I should think you’re all rather relieved.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Crawleighs were a bit disappointed,” answered Carstairs;
“but it might have been worse. Relieved? I don’t
<em>know</em>. When I said that was the <em>end</em> of Barbara...
There’s a curious little group that my cousin Jim Loring used
to call “the Sensationalists”; they were always playing a
part and pulling up their psychology by the roots to see how
it was growing. Anything for a new emotion! Barbara
always had more personality than the rest of them put together
and she led them till she really made London too hot
to hold her. Then the war came. The men were killed off
and the women married; but the old Adam’s still alive in
some of them. I’m wondering what Barbara’s next outbreak
will be; she had one emotion by marrying a tame-cat Irish
squireen, but how long she’ll stick to him... I’m sure we’ve
not finished with her yet. You’ll find London a curious
place... Look here, if we’re going to be in time, I must go
up; I haven’t unpacked yet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At the creak of chairs, Eric Lane buried himself in his
paper, only looking up when the bull-necked, consequential
young man and his lithe, decorative companion had sauntered
languorously past, leaving in his nostrils an elusive hint
of violets and in his memory a dissolving view of pearls,
a gold bag, white gloves, a cloak tentatively martial and
exquisitely neat shoes. Lady John he had never seen before;
<span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span>Carstairs he now remembered as a young man with too
much chin and too little hair, intermittently to be found
in London theatres; they had overlapped for a year or two
at Oxford where Carstairs won a brief notoriety by removing
the minute hand of the General Post Office clock every Sunday
night throughout one term; twelve years in the diplomatic
service had robbed him of irresponsibility without
putting anything in its place. As they disappeared from
sight, Eric threw his paper away and lighted a cigar. After
long months of solitude, it was stimulating to hear how the
world represented by Carstairs summarized and dismissed
his contribution to the romantic Odyssey of Lady Barbara
Neave.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had not, himself, been able to dismiss it so easily; and,
when he left England at the end of 1916, Eric was determined
never to come back. His health was shattered; Dr.
Gaisford bluntly threatened him with a sanatorium; and he
needed distance and change of work to heal a bruised spirit.
After lecturing in the United States, he travelled for six
months in South America and started on an aimless and
endless holiday in Japan. While he was in Tokio, he heard
that Barbara was married. At a time when the German
armies were pouring down on Paris, the news was telegraphed
all over the world; and the press of Tokio, New
York, Ottawa, Sydney and Calcutta gave her a column of
description. Eric was dining with two men from the Embassy,
and throughout the evening they discussed nothing
else. When he first saw the headline: “<cite>Marriage of Lady
Barbara Neave</cite>,” he fought for breath as though his heart
had stopped; then, with slowly returning composure, he
realized for the first time that finality had been achieved and
that, in all the months when he was philosophizing and
hardening his heart, he had been waiting for a fantastic
miracle to happen, hoping to see Barbara, breathless and dusty
<span class='pageno' title='21' id='Page_21'></span>from the train, coming into his hotel. The London telegram
killed his faith in romance.</p>

<p class='c009'>And the excited column of small type killed his faith in
women, for Barbara had apparently walked into the street
and married the first man that she saw....</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who’s this Oakleigh?,” asked his host, squeezing the last
drop of relish out of the story. “I’ve never heard of him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He’s a very nice fellow,” Eric found himself answering.
Oakleigh henceforth was to have the stolen intoxication of
glorying in Barbara when she was well and comforting her
when she was ill, of seeing her great eyes change from
mockery to tenderness and from tenderness to ecstasy; but
Oakleigh could never have from her those fifteen fevered
months when their hearts had beaten together... “I’ve
known him ever since I was at Oxford. He used to be in
the House; and then he ran a paper... He has a place in
Ireland—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What they call ‘a suitable alliance’?,” suggested his host.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, very.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s rather a disappointing finish to her career...”</p>

<p class='c009'>The gossiping discussion rambled on, introducing name
after name of the men whom Lady Barbara had been expected
to marry. Eric waited for his own and, when
it was not cited, relapsed into reverie. He had received a
letter that morning from his sister, telling him that she was
engaged and asking whether he would be home in time for
the wedding. If he had ever doubted, there was now no
question of returning to England; he was too well known
to be left in peace. The Oakleighs and Neaves, the Knightriders
and Lorings, the Pentyres and Carstairs, the Maitlands
and Poynters all moved in the same little set of three
or four hundred people. Fifteen years before he had
dreamed at Oxford of the day when he would burst upon
their startled world and hold it captive; the dream had sustained
him through the mortification of neglect and the
<span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span>despair of ill-health until of a sudden the reality threw his
dream into shadow. In London, in Boston, in Tokio he
was recognized in the street; to escape the fulfilment of his
own prayers he had to travel by unfamiliar lines and hide
himself in unknown hotels; for ultimate and enduring sanctuary
he must retire to a land untouched by books and
theatres.</p>

<p class='c009'>After three months’ desultory wandering he returned to
Tokio and booked a passage to China. Already his health
was improving; and, if he could lose all touch with English
ways of thought, he might begin to lose touch with himself,
to shed his personality, almost to change his identity; upcountry
it must be possible to find a civilization and scenery
so strange that it would absorb him. As he left his hotel for
the shipping office, he was handed a cable from his American
agent:</p>

<p class='c009'>“<cite>Following from Lane Lashmar Hampshire England for
you care of me despatched fourteenth your father seriously
ill think you should return as soon as possible.</cite>”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric studied the time of despatch and retransmission with
stupid deliberation, giving himself time to recover from the
shock. This meant, of course, that his father was dying,
was perhaps already dead; and it was his duty to be shocked.
Lashmar on the fourteenth, New York on the sixteenth,
Tokio on the eighteenth;—the war had made cabling a slow
business... He was a selfish brute not to have told his
mother where he was going instead of leaving her to track
him through his American agent and, before that, through
his London agent. His father had never been ill since he
was a child, but he had overworked for years; this probably
meant a stroke....</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric discovered that he was quite dispassionate; perhaps
he was too much numbed to feel. He must of course return
immediately; if anything happened, the eldest son
<span class='pageno' title='23' id='Page_23'></span>must be at hand. Once in England, he must let the future
take care of itself.</p>

<p class='c009'>Three weeks later he landed at San Francisco and arrived
in New York two days before the armistice was signed.
“Mother’s Son” was still running at the Grafton; he was met
unexpectedly at the station, and, before the day was out, two
reporters had called at the Majestic and sought an interview.
He tried to dine by himself and was instantly caught up by
a group of friends who set about organizing a banquet in
his honour. A private party of twelve swept within twenty-four
hours far beyond the organizer’s control. Half New
York had been to one or other of the plays; scores of people
had already met him, hundreds more wanted to meet him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look at it this way,” said his agent, Justus Grant, defensively.
“Every one knows you’re here. Well, if it gets
out that we’ve given you a dinner and cornered you, they’ll
all ask why in Hell they weren’t invited. I’ve got to live in
New York, and you haven’t. It’s only one speech, whether
we’re twelve or twelve hundred. And you’ve only to stand
and shake a few more hands.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll do my best,” Eric promised with ebbing patience.
“It’s a tremendous honour....”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he began reading the letters which he had brought
from his agent’s. Lady Lane wrote to confirm her cable and
to say that his father had indeed had a stroke. His life was
no longer in danger, though for some days his speech had
been affected and many months must go by before he could
resume work. There was no immediate urgency for Eric
to return; he must decide for himself. Of course, he had
been terribly missed, and every one was looking forward to
seeing him.</p>

<p class='c009'>After resolving never to go back to England, Eric felt
that nothing would now keep him away. There was almost
everything to be said against it, and, in its favour, only that
he had secured a cabin where others had tried and failed.
<span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'></span>The reason was frivolous, his mind was aimless; and he
accepted the reason, because it chimed with his mood of
aimlessness. Moreover—a reason yet more frivolous!—Justus
Grant was arranging a farewell dinner for him, and,
after being bidden God-speed, he could not decently loiter
in New York any longer. Of such stuff were made the
cardinal decisions of a man’s life. Three years earlier, on
the night of his first meeting with Barbara Neave, she had
asked him to wait till the end of her rubber and to take her
home.</p>

<p class='c009'>The crowd in the winter garden was thinning, and Eric
could study in peace the notes which he had jotted down
for his speech. Though Carstairs’ chatter had set his nerves
jangling, he must face a graver ordeal when he was welcomed
to the midst of Barbara’s friends in London; if for the
moment he could not abdicate, he must sit his throne
worthily; but he felt contempt for this servile herd which
abased itself before him. For two years he had lived in
isolation; and, if he was now flung face to face with his
public, he would shew that he could preserve his isolation in
their midst.</p>

<p class='c009'>He roused from moody reverie to find his host standing,
watch in hand, before him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Haven’t you dressed yet?,” asked Grant anxiously.
“The automobile’s at the door.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Instead of thinking about his speech, Eric was only brooding
over the hollowness of his belated, unwanted triumph;
three years earlier it would have intoxicated him to take
New York or London by storm, but he was wondering for
the first time whether this lust for theatrical sensationalism
did not really lower him to the level of Barbara Neave and
her school. Certainly he had outgrown the phase so much
that he would have been almost a little glad to shew his contempt
by making every one wait....</p>

<p class='c009'>For a moment he pretended to be unconscious of Grant’s
<span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'></span>presence; then he was stung to activity by a fear that this
scorn of soul was only another experiment in sensationalism....</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll be ready in ten minutes,” he cried, as he ran out of
the winter garden. For one night he must enter into the
spirit of his company; after that he would hide himself
where he could escape equally the emotion of courting
triumph and of avoiding it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hundreds were assembled at the Plaza, when he arrived:
how many hundreds he was too indifferent to enquire, but
they were lined up in rows; the rumble of countless conversations
shrank to a whisper and died away in a moment’s
silence; then every one who knew him hastened to shake
hands, while the rest begged to be introduced. For all his
indifference, Eric was warmed by his reception. Throughout
his wanderings in South America and Japan, imagination
and will had swung alternate hammers to fashion a new
life which he could find worth living. Here was acclamation.
The throne awaited him, if he could mount it
worthily. He was but thirty-five, his health had returned to
him... All his life he had prayed for this moment of
domination....</p>

<p class='c009'>A waiter interrupted the chorus of welcome by thrusting
his way forward with a tray of cocktails and caviare sandwiches.
In the moment’s lull Eric saw Carstairs at his elbow
and turned to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I believe we <em>have</em> met,” he said, holding out his hand.
“I just missed you when I called at the Embassy last year.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Carstairs shook hands awkwardly and muttered an introduction
to his wife.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When I was in Japan, I saw that Barbara had married
my friend George Oakleigh,” Eric went on. “I know them
both very well. Jim Loring, of course, was one of my
greatest friends. And your mother used to be kind enough
to ask me to some of her parties.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span>He had dropped his indifference in a calculated effort to
shew these Carstairs that, even if they did not want to meet
him, he would meet them or not as he liked. This dinner,
after all, was his apotheosis; some one at his elbow was
whispering that five hundred tickets had been sold and that
the committee could have sold more than twice that number.
It was astonishing that a thousand educated men and women
had no better use for their time and money; astonishing, too,
that he had allowed himself to be dragged out for public
display, for in all that vast gathering there was not one
eager face that he wished ever to see again. Indifference
and aloofness returned as a protection against such a sense
of loneliness as he had never known when he was most
isolated.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I believe we’re going by your boat,” said Lady John.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That will be delightful,” Eric answered.</p>

<p class='c009'>The babble of voices rose and swelled until the chairman
wound his way back to Eric’s side and led him into the
dining-room. Detachment changed for a moment to antagonism
as he walked between the long whispering rows:
warm waves of scent beat upon his cheeks; before, behind
and on either side he felt the magnetism of a thousand eyes
drawing him out of his self-sufficiency and assailing his
frozen reserve. As quickly as his companion would allow,
he walked on, looking stiffly ahead, to the seat of honour.
There, while the rigid, whispering rows broke up and poured
in at his heels, he looked idly at the men and women who
made up a world which he had left for ever. It was difficult
to see all the tables and impossible to count his hosts; but
the printed plan shewed him name after honoured name;
New York political, New York a night’s lodging for itinerant
diplomacy, New York literary and artistic, New York
rich, New York fashionable and New York merely curious
had crowded into the great room; and his health was to be
proposed by Nelson Millbank, who had been ambassador in
<span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span>London when Eric was still unborn. Through the flowers,
over the little Stars and Stripes and the Union Jacks fluttering
between the vases he tried to identify those who were
nearest to him. Every one seemed to be looking in his direction;
and, to escape their eyes, he turned to his neighbour.</p>

<p class='c009'>“America’s always been uncommonly good to me, Mr.
Millbank,” he said, “but I’ve never had anything of this
kind before.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You will shew your gratitude by coming back,” was the
answer, “though we feel that the indebtedness lies the other
way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m leaving you from necessity and not choice.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“For leisure—and for more plays, we hope. And what
psychological material, Mr. Lane! Had I your genius and
your youth... The convulsion’s as great, when you turn
a soldier into a civilian, as when you turn a civilian into a
soldier. It will be your privilege to capture and preserve
for us the impression of a world in travail. A man gets his
discharge papers one morning—and finds himself with an old
life to take up or a new life to make....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes. I’ve been thinking of that for some time,” said
Eric, half to himself. “Though I’m not a soldier... It’s
all right if he himself has changed with the world around
him; in peace the individual moves more quickly than the
mass, but in war the mass moves more quickly than the individual.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He stroked his chin thoughtfully and looked up to find the
woman opposite him leaning forward with a faint air of
diffidence and a question in embryo.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s no old life for women to take up, is there?” she
asked, plucking up courage, but evidently disconcerted by
the clear ascendancy of her own voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Woman is unchanging,” Eric answered, “she resigns
herself to civilization, but she has never been civilized. Man
is, to her, a physiological incident and a domestic accessory,
<span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span>so that a war only affects woman by withdrawing so many
potential fathers of her children and supporters of her
house.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He glanced covertly at the plan of the table and found
opposite his own name that of Lady Woodstock. Sir
Matthew Woodstock, three chairs away, was a partner in
Woodstock, McArthur and Company and had been sent to
America by the Ministry of Munitions as British representative
on the Purchasing and Priority Council.</p>

<p class='c009'>To right and left rose an eager debate on sex and conduct.
Eric had thrown them a bait which, he knew well,
few men and no woman could resist. An “academic”
discussion of sex enabled them to talk about themselves,
to indulge their own sex-curiosity, to fancy themselves
wholesomely fearless and unprejudiced; it enabled him to
dine peacefully in the soothing haze of sham-intellectuality
and to study anew the names on the table-plan. Next to
Carstairs he saw Mrs. O’Rane deep in conversation with
John Gaymer; next to him was Lady John, with O’Rane on
her other side. It was indeed no great exaggeration to say
that there were more British officials than Americans in
New York; and the sight of this compact alien colony set
Eric thinking about his speech. He was unlikely to enter
the Plaza again, but he could not spend a week in London
without meeting O’Rane or Gaymer; his valediction should
be something for them to remember and quote when he had
slipped through their hands into a retirement from which,
this time, there would be no return... He was roused by
the touch of a woman’s hand on his sleeve. Finding him unoccupied,
his neighbour was asking him to sign her <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">menu</span></i>.
Instantly her example was followed by every one who saw
him writing; <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">menus</span></i> were passed from hand to hand, waiters
appeared from other tables with piled-up trays; he was still
signing when Nelson Millbank whispered a question and
stood up to propose the toast of the evening.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'></span>Eric lighted his cigar and leaned back, looking over the
heads of the diners to a vast fan-group of the Allied flags,
draped over the main door. At a semicircular table twenty
feet away the press-men were industriously scribbling: two
were looking up at him from their sketch-books and down
to the sketch-books again; he posed himself and sat patiently
still. Millbank’s rising had been greeted with a storm of
cheers and clapping; his opening sentences called forth fresh
cheers, and punctually thereafter, at the polished end of
each resonant period, as he half turned to the guest of the
evening or indicated him with a slight movement of his
hand, there was a new outburst of applause.</p>

<p class='c009'>Though he listened with only half his attention, Eric knew
that it was a great speech from a man who had been known
for more than forty years as one of the greatest after-dinner
speakers in America. That much, at least, he had expected,
but he was hardly prepared for the white-hot enthusiasm of
the audience. This, if anything, should stimulate a man
to better work than he had ever yet accomplished; but for
two years all work had mysteriously lost its savour and
purpose. If he ever wrote again, he would still be artist
enough to give forth only the best that was in him, but he
no longer cared for the applause of a blurred, indistinguishable
mob; his plays, indeed, were running in three continents,
but in a thousand audiences there was no one whose judgement
mattered to him as in the old days when above “the mad
houseful’s plaudits” he looked “through all the roaring and
the wreaths” for one half smile of praise from Barbara.
Had all these bright-eyed men and women masked their
faces, were Millbank speaking an unknown tongue, Eric
could not have had less in common with them. Mrs. O’Rane
threw him a dazzling glance of congratulation; and, before
he could bow, he had to overcome his surprise that she had
recognized him. In all this funeral throng he alone knew
that for two years he had been dead....</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'></span>Voice, gesture and mounting sentiment shewed that the
peroration was at hand:</p>

<p class='c009'>“And, lastly, I thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for the
honour and the opportunity of having my name associated
for a moment of one night with the loved name of our guest.
He and I stand at the remote opposite ends of life, so that
I cannot hope to meet him often again. You, who will meet
him and see him and read him, I congratulate and envy. I
ask you to rise and join me in wishing him long life, health
and prosperity.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was an instant’s silence, and the room rose in a wave
of black and white. “Lane! Lane! Lane!” The thundering
repetition of his name drowned the clink of the glasses,
the individual toasts and even the college yell which rocketed
from the end of the room. Eric bowed to Millbank, then
turned slowly and inclined his head to right, to left and in
front. The speech had intoxicated them; they looked at him
with shining eyes, an inch removed from hysteria.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And what do they expect I can say after that, sir?” Eric
whispered to Millbank, as the applause died slowly away and
he sat down.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Take your time, Mr. Lane.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Once more every one was looking at him in a silence
broken only by a buzzing commentary on Millbank’s speech.
Eric straightened his tie, pulled down his waistcoat and laid
his watch on the table beside his finger-bowl. As he pushed
back his chair and slowly drew himself erect, he caught sight
of his reflection in three long mirrors: black-haired and
white-cheeked, aquiline and thin, with deep-set brown eyes
and lips tightly compressed, he could fancy that he was
looking at his own dead body. The applause broke out again,
ten times louder and longer than before; there was a blinding
flash of silver light from a magnesium flare, followed by
dense grey clouds of smoke. As they cleared away, he once
more established the position of Carstairs and his wife,
<span class='pageno' title='31' id='Page_31'></span>holding himself upright and only touching the table with
the tips of his fingers. Though slightly built, he was tall
enough to dominate an audience; in three years of public
speaking he had acquired such composure that he could
stand for a full minute without saying anything. It was a
test of grip; if he could hold his company without speaking, he
could do what he liked with it afterwards. Before he turned
to Millbank, the great room was as silent as the <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Festspielhaus</span></i>
before the opening bar of Parsifal. Something seemed to
have come to life within him, for he now felt that he must
at all costs eclipse Millbank’s speech; if he could not match
his slow stateliness of eloquence and diction, he would master
him in pure lyrical fire and music....</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. Millbank, Your Excellencies, My Lords, Ladies
and Gentlemen...”</p>

<p class='c009'>The voice was flexible and light, capable of infinite emotional
variation, boyish and appealing after Millbank’s deep
resonance. Eric had discarded and forgotten his rehearsed
speech. Dreary months of stereotyped lecturing set him
ablaze to speak his soul. The audience had surrendered to
his presence and surrendered again to his voice; he could
twist every man and woman round his finger....</p>

<p class='c009'>Forty minutes had passed before he sat down. There
was no applause, for none dared break the silence; but he
had made them laugh and he had brought tears into the
eyes of the woman opposite; the audience had quivered and
gasped. Now, if they had not guessed it before, they knew
how he inspired with his own genius the actors who interpreted
his plays; henceforth they would recognize whose
personality it was that spread magnetically across the foot-lights...
He picked up the dead cigar from his plate and
felt for a match. He would have liked to look at Carstairs,
but it was unnecessary; Carstairs himself, with his unmistakable
English drawl, broke the silence by exclaiming: “Oh,
I say, that was devilish good, you know!” Thereat the pent
<span class='pageno' title='32' id='Page_32'></span>storm of cheering gushed forth as though he had touched a
spring.</p>

<p class='c009'>There followed a presentation and more introductions.
Eric stood bowing to congratulations and trying to answer
five questions at a time until the chairman rescued him and
took him back to the Majestic. Even there he was constrained
to hold a new court and to accept the homage of
those who had not found an opportunity of speaking to him
before. Mid-night was striking as he shook the last hand
and lighted his last cigar; with it came nervous exhaustion
and an abrupt reaction, in which once more he seemed to
have crossed the boundary between two lives and to be wandering
alone in eternal emptiness....</p>

<p class='c009'>As he walked back to the winter garden a woman rose
from her chair and hurried up to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. Lane, I <em>must</em> thank you for that speech! It was
wonderful! I’ve never heard anything like it. Aren’t you
dreadfully tired?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The cloak and scarf kept him for a moment from recognizing
her as the woman who had sat opposite him at dinner.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am, rather,” he answered, leaning against the arm of
a chair. “But it’s the last speech I shall ever make.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In America, you mean? It’s so glorious to feel that I’ve
actually met you! You’re crossing on the <cite>Lithuania</cite>, aren’t
you? So are we. I shall hope to see you on board. And I
shall make a thorough nuisance of myself by asking you to
write in my autograph book. Now I mustn’t keep you; I
expect you’ve all sorts of packing to do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m glad to say I haven’t unpacked since I left Japan...
Good-night, Lady Woodstock.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She looked up at him curiously for a moment and then
broke into a laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>I’m</em> not—Mr. Lane, you’re not mistaking me for Lady
Woodstock, are you?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'></span>“I thought you were. I saw your name on the plan of
the table—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, but that was because she was too tired to come. Sir
Matthew brought me in her place. <em>Wasn’t</em> that a piece of
luck for me? I’m his secretary. He’s not come in yet, has
he? I simply daren’t go to bed until I’ve found out whether
he has any more work for me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He was still at the Plaza, when I left,” said Eric.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then I suppose I must wait up for him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She chose herself a chair, threw open her cloak and untied
the scarf from her hair. Now that the girl had told him
what she was, Eric wondered how he could ever have imagined
her to be anything else. She looked eighteen or twenty
and displayed the brisk assurance which he had come to regard
as a woman’s price of admission to the temporary civil
service. Her hair was bobbed and surrounded with a red
band; a serviceable black dress revealed slender arms and
shoulders; and her regular, rather sharp features were agreeably
relieved by grey-blue eyes which seemed younger and
less self-confident than the rest of her. Eric had met and
striven to avoid very many of her type in English government
offices; they were at all times too much emancipated for his
liking, too energetic, efficient and certain of themselves, too
conscious of sex-superiority to concern themselves with sex-equality.
Sir Matthew Woodstock’s secretary looked devastatingly
conscientious and practical; she billeted herself in
the most comfortable chair with the determination which he
could imagine her shewing when she arranged appointments
and guarded her employer from unauthorized telephone assaults.
And she would call him her “chief” rather than her
“employer.”...</p>

<p class='c009'>Force of habit, rather than any personal interest, had led
Eric to spend a moment in cataloguing her; thereafter he
was only concerned to find a polite excuse for going to bed.
The girl seemed conscious that she had thrust herself upon
<span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'></span>him, for, after a short silence, she looked at her watch and
exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’d no idea it was so late! Mr. Lane, I mustn’t keep
you up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She coloured bashfully as she spoke, and Eric felt that he
had been unkind in not putting her at ease. The flush so
changed her <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">façade</span></i> of efficiency and determination that,
though she evidently wanted him to stay, she did not know
how to ask.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll finish my cigar with you, if I may,” he said. “You
must have a wearing life with Sir Matthew, if he always
keeps you up as late as this. Have you been with him long?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The jejune encouragement restored her composure; and
Eric saw with dismay that he must talk in self-defence or
submit to unrestricted loquacity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Two years,” she answered; then in rapid, unsought confidence:
“You see, he and father were great friends at
Cambridge, and, when I wanted to do war-work, father
wouldn’t let me learn to make munitions and mother wouldn’t
let me go into an office. They’re afraid to allow me out of
their sight. I wanted to nurse or drive a car, but father
<em>and</em> mother—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You have a lot to put up with from your parents!,” Eric
interrupted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, they’re hopeless. I expect you’ve met father—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t even know your name, as you assure me you’re
<em>not</em> Lady Woodstock.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ivy Maitland. Father’s the judge, you know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know him, but he’s a brother of the general, isn’t
he? I know Lady Maitland very well—your aunt, I mean.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, as if mother knew anybody or anybody knew mother!
Well, I had to do something: both my sisters were married,
and my brothers were fighting. Then Sir Matthew <em>wanted</em>
a secretary....”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric wondered how quickly he could finish his cigar without
<span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span>spoiling it, then settled resignedly in his chair and listened
with eyes half-closed. Miss Maitland had worked for Sir
Matthew Woodstock in London, New York, Paris, Rome
and Petrograd, crowding into two years more excitement
and experiences than she had dreamed of knowing in a life-time.
She was nineteen and looking for new worlds to
explore, but, as with Alexander on the confines of India, the
army insisted on returning home: and there, Sir Matthew
told her with regret, he had his own trained staff, and there
would be no work for her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What are you going to do when you get back to England?,”
asked Eric in the first negotiable pause.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Get hold of a new job before father has time to see that
the war’s over,” she answered promptly. “There’ll be a row,
of course, when he finds out... D’you employ a secretary
in England, Mr. Lane?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I used to.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you will again. Will you take me? Sir Matthew
will tell you that I’m a first-rate shorthand-typist, I’m fairly
well-educated, I’m intelligent, I hope I’ve got a certain
amount of tact. <em>I</em>’ll tell you that I’m honest—honest in the
sense that, when I take money from a person, I work my
fingers to the bones for him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric smiled and shook his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It wouldn’t be very practicable,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why not? I’ll come to you for a month without salary!
Three months! I can’t afford more than that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Underneath her eagerness Eric fancied that he could
detect something more than restless impetuosity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear Miss Maitland, you must think me very sordid,”
he laughed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, why won’t you give me a trial?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“For purely conventional reasons. I know your uncle and
aunt very well. I’m not going to be party to a conspiracy
for taking away the daughter of a very eminent judge against
<span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span>his wishes. If I can help you to find work of which your
parents approve, I’ll do what I can. But I’ve been away from
England so long that I can’t promise anything; and I’ve no
idea how long I shall be there.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The cigar was but half-finished, but he threw it away and
shook hands, trying not to see that she was disappointed but
in no doubt that it was hardly reasonable for him to be
stampeded by any mercurial nineteen-year-old to whom he
shewed a moment’s civility.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s awfully good of you, I feel I’ve no right to bother
you like this,” she answered. “I <em>meant</em> to talk about your
plays; and I’ve only talked about myself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was more interesting—to me. If you think I can help
in any way, write to me at the Regency Theatre or the
Thespian Club, Grosvenor Place.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I hope to see you on the boat.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric had not overlooked that possibility, but he decided
that he did not want to meet Miss Ivy Maitland again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But—in case we don’t,” he said. “Good-night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In his own room he threw open the window to liberate
the day’s stifling accumulation of steam-heating. Kneeling
on a chair with his chin on his hands, he looked down on a
plateau of roofs startlingly punctuated by the blazing bean-stalks
of slender giant buildings. It was the last time that
he would see New York at night, the last time that he would
be in America. He had made his last speech; he hoped
devoutly that he had submitted for the last time to the
unintelligent exuberance of too appreciative school-girls....</p>

<p class='c009'>At three o’clock his vigil was not yet ended, but he turned
from the window with a shiver and began to undress. It
was well enough to make this catalogue of things that he
would never do again, but for two years he had been trying
to discover what life he could fashion for himself in their
stead.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m beaten,” he whispered to the darkness as he turned
<span class='pageno' title='37' id='Page_37'></span>restlessly from side to side. “I may as well admit it...
I’ve never said it before in all my life. I never thought I
<em>should</em> say it; and I can still put up a good bluff on occasion.
But I’m beaten....”</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>The</span> dinner at the Plaza, described at length and extravagantly
illustrated in a dozen papers, was hardly a greater
personal triumph than the farewell scenes on board the
<cite>Lithuania</cite>. Ambassadors honoured and beloved had left in
less magnificence. Scores of his friends came on board to
bid Eric good-bye; the management of the Grafton filled
his state-room with hot-house roses, and he was loaded with
presents ranging from a gold cigar-case to an unsinkable
swimming-suit; German submarines were being recalled, but
his friends would not expose him to the risk of a belated
straggler or of a forgotten mine-field.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the land receded and vanished, Eric turned away from
the rail and went below. He had been watched ever since
he came on board; round, wondering eyes followed the
coming and going of his friends, interested and envious eyes
explored the parcels which mounted like a rampart on the
deck more quickly than his steward could carry them away.
Eager whispers rippled about him, becoming hushed at his
approach. So Irving and Melba had travelled—in regal state
and more than regal loneliness.</p>

<p class='c009'>He spent the first day in his cabin, unpacking and re-packing,
while his steward contrived supplementary cases
for his spoils. In the saloon, which he was the last to reach
and the first to leave, his seat was between Lady Woodstock,
<span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span>who seemed afraid to speak, and Lady John Carstairs, who
retired from sight at the first roll of the boat. The passenger-list
was made up almost wholly of soldiers and government
officials, for the most part unknown to Eric and too much
occupied with consultations and reports to force their company
upon a man who was conspicuously avoiding it. John
Gaymer, whom he had met at long intervals during three or
four years and who had been seconded as an instructor at
one of the American aerodromes, made a facetious comment
on the Plaza dinner as an overture of friendship before
asking him to play poker; and David O’Rane, returning from
a campaign of propaganda in the Middle West, tried to
persuade Eric to transfer himself to the Chief Engineer’s
table. For the rest, he was left in peace until the third day
when, on entering the smoke-room in search of matches, he
was caught by Carstairs and pressed to join him for a cocktail.
At once and with apparent carelessness, four other men
attached themselves to the table and conscientiously offered
Eric their compliments on his work and their thanks for the
opportunity of meeting him. He acknowledged the tribute
with a practised show of gratification and submitted to
diffident questions on his method of composition and his
theories of art. When at last he excused himself and went
out on deck, O’Rane overtook him and suggested a stroll
before dinner.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve hardly had a word with you since we came on board,
Eric,” he began. “You’ve not been seedy, have you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, but I’ve reached an age when I can’t move without
running across people I know. From one end of America
to the other, in Japan, here... On a ship I like to escape
my fellow man and have—a rest... I don’t mean <em>you</em>, of
course, but the people who feel they must congratulate me
on a play that I wish I’d never written....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m glad you make an exception in my favour, though I
tell you frankly that I’m much too old a friend to be shaken
<span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'></span>off easily. It must be seventeen years since we first met.
D’you remember the Phoenix dinners at Oxford? Jim
Loring, Summertown, Draycott, Sinclair—<em>they</em>’re all gone;
George Oakleigh—married; you, Jack Waring and me—knocked
out to a certain extent; Knightrider and Deganway
pursuing the noiseless tenour of their way... You can
crowd a great deal into seventeen years....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve never forgotten the night when you cast our
horoscopes for us,” murmured Eric.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve sometimes tried to forget it... We were only
about twenty, I gave every man ten years’ run. It’s been
too frightfully true. D’you remember that even in those
days I told you we should turn out one genius? I told you
to your face who it would be.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric unlinked his arm on the plea of wanting to refill his
pipe. What with knocking out the ashes and sacrificing four
matches to a head wind, he gave himself time to become
collected.</p>

<p class='c009'>“One man was to achieve some kind of distinction,” he
said with an effort of memory. “And one was to make
money... Touch wood and all that sort of thing, but in
eighteen months I made more than I thought I could make
in a life-time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“With fame thrown in,” added O’Rane. “That being so,
I couldn’t understand your speech at the Plaza.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They walked the length of the deck before Eric answered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It went down very well,” he protested.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes! And no doubt you looked very nice. The
decent women would always fall in love with you because
you look delicate and interesting; and the fools because they
think you’re spiritual. And I’ve no doubt your button-hole
and gestures and lumps in the throat were perfect; you’re
an old stage hand. I couldn’t see any of that, but I could
hear. You must be careful, old man, before you try to put
it over people who can’t see; we hear the very <em>devil</em> of a
<span class='pageno' title='41' id='Page_41'></span>lot... And you must admit it was a rotten speech for you
to make. Perhaps I know as much as most people about
your private affairs; it was the yelp of a whipped cur.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But—I don’t know what you’re driving at! They gave
me a marvellous reception, and I—I let myself go. I told
’em what it meant to me, the years of agony and bloody
sweat... God! I laid myself bare and talked about art
like a Chelsea poet. It had taken me half my life to get
there... And you say it was insincere!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“As you’d stripped so far, you might have talked about
the future a bit,” suggested O’Rane. “It was that silence
I heard most distinctly... What are you going to do when
you get to England?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Get out again as soon as possible.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dear man, you can’t get away from yourself any more
than a kitten can catch its own tail. It’s time you pulled
yourself together.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric stifled a sigh before it could reach his companion’s
too acute hearing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m a bit tired... As you know so much, you may as
well know that, after that dinner, I knelt staring out into
the night, thinking it all over; and at the end I had to admit
I was beaten,” he added quickly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That was what I rudely described as the “whipped cur”
note in your speech,” laughed O’Rane. “On my soul and
honour, I should think a bit better of you if you’d quietly
cut your throat. As you <em>haven’t</em>... Look here, Eric,
I’ve had one or two facers in my time; and I think, when
the smash <em>has</em> come, the only thing to do is to count the
arms and legs that are left and see what show you can
make with <em>them</em>. (When I was blinded, I <em>did</em> wander out
in the approved “Light That Failed” spirit and try to take
a bullet through the brain; but to a certain extent one had
lost one’s head, and I’ve never dared tell a soul but George
Oakleigh...) It’s no good, I’m sure, preserving an
<span class='pageno' title='42' id='Page_42'></span>amputated limb in spirits of wine. You forget you’ve lost
a hand when you forget you’ve ever had it to lose. Think
of yourself as born one-handed; in other words, think of
yourself as a new personality; in other words, don’t think of
yourself at all. Can you do that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose it can be done if one makes a big enough effort.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you’ll succeed...”</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>Find me B Deck, there’s a good fellow. It always takes me
about four days to feel my way round a strange ship. You
don’t want to talk about this? I thought not... But
don’t waste a week of good Atlantic, skulking in a hot stateroom....”</p>

<p class='c009'>On the following day Eric prospected cautiously among
the rest of the passengers. The natural selection common
to life on every liner was still in progress: the socially ambitious
had struggled to the captain’s table in the saloon;
more experienced travellers were making friends with the
purser. The government officials, unconsciously jaunty in
their tweed caps and life-belts, separated into the corners of
the smoking-room and drew up voluminous reports, competing
craftily for the services of two overworked and seasick
shorthand-writers; the returning soldiers exercised
themselves with deck-tennis in the morning and scoured the
ship for bridge-players in the afternoon. There were not
more than six women on board, and these left Eric alone
when they had secured his autograph. A distinction more
subtile than that of mere age sent the older men to the feet
of Mrs. O’Rane, while the younger ranged themselves round
Ivy Maitland. Eric encountered her on the fifth day, looking
no more than sixteen in tennis shoes and white stockings,
woollen jersey and white Tam-o’-Shanter; she treated him
to a friendly “good-morning”, when they met, striding round
<span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span>the deck before breakfast; but her first conversation in New
York did not encourage her to make further advances, and
there were readier triumphs with Gaymer and the other
soldiers of his age.</p>

<p class='c009'>The three days of deliberate isolation had drawn round
Eric a cordon which his fellow-travellers were at first reluctant
to penetrate; but, when the coast of Ireland came
in sight, the general reserve broke down for a moment:
Lady John Carstairs hoped that he would come and see
them in London; Sir Matthew Woodstock confessed bluffly
to admiration of his plays; and on their last night on board
Ivy Maitland, armed with her autograph-book, stalked him
to the boat-deck and reminded him of his promise.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I expect you thought me very forward in New York,”
she began brightly. “I did <em>so</em> want to meet you... What
are you going to write? Something <em>nice</em>, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How would ‘Children obey your parents’ do?” asked
Eric.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I’d rather have nothing than that... You see, you
don’t know father, and I <em>do</em>...” She laughed a little
impatiently and painted a clever and undutiful picture of
their life in the Cromwell Road and her earliest recollection
of the overworked junior who returned at half-past eight
for a dinner which he persisted in ordering for eight, and
of a submissive mother who brewed him cocoa at five o’clock
in the morning and was too tired to entertain or be entertained
at night. The vacations, consecrated to golf at Brancaster,
had enabled the two elder sisters to escape into
matrimony with a couple of promising chancery barristers.
(The “promise” was largely invented by Mr. Justice Maitland
by means of a dilemma which amused his humour and
saved his pocket. “If a young man’s worth his salt, he
doesn’t want anything from me. If he’s <em>not</em> worth his salt,
don’t marry him. Of course, I don’t expect you to listen to
anything <em>I</em> say...”). The two brothers had drifted from
<span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'></span>Cambridge into the army, leaving Ivy to bear the full brunt
of her father’s jurisdiction. “It was bad enough before,
but I couldn’t go back to it after this.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What will you do?,” Eric asked, as he began to write.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I want to live my own life... work... money of
my own,” she answered vaguely. “I don’t want to ask them
for <em>leave</em> to go to a dance, <em>leave</em> to do this and that....”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric looked for a moment at the petulant little face and
made no comment. Ivy Maitland collected other people’s
phrases with the undiscriminating energy of a rag-picker;
her brain was fermenting with ill-digested theories; but,
when she came to put them into practice, ignorance or wilfulness
set her doing all the things that she should have
instinctively avoided. Decorum habitually took a holiday
on board a big liner, but Ivy’s idea of emancipation consisted
in sitting on the boat-deck with the least desirable of the returning
soldiers. On the second day out, Lady Woodstock
had been compelled to detach her from a boisterous ring of
cocktail-drinkers in the smoking-room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re very young, Miss Maitland,” he said at length.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I’ve been in all sorts of places. And girls nowadays
<em>can</em> take care of themselves... Well, I mustn’t keep you.
Every one wants to say good-bye. I wish I were famous!”</p>

<p class='c009'>As she ran away, Eric settled himself to the exchange of
addresses and invitations which always lent an insincere
good-will to the last day of a voyage. O’Rane he was careful
to avoid, for, after the Plaza dinner and in this new flattering
farewell, he felt unable to live up to the greatness which his
admirers thrust upon him, however much he might talk of
the big effort that he intended to make. In his return to
England they saw triumph where he felt only despair. Every
mile brought him nearer to streets and houses, theatres and
restaurants haunted by the ghosts of his dead life; as the
<cite>Lithuania</cite> steamed majestically into the Mersey, he felt that
he was going into action....</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'></span>As the great ship slowed to a standstill, a boat-load of
assertive officials hurried on board. Port authorities, health
authorities, emissaries of Scotland Yard... Eric was still
idly wondering who they were, when the chief steward
thrust a sheaf of telegrams into his hand. Welcome and
good wishes, welcome and good wishes... This was a
reduced replica of New York! There were telegrams from
the family, telegrams from friends, telegrams from the
theatre and from half-forgotten societies. He crammed them
uncomprehendingly into his pocket, as a short, buoyant
figure, rime-white in the mist, lined and mischievous as a
monkey, steered towards him and slapped a crushing hand
of welcome on to his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Manders!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Eric, boy! You bet you never expected to see <em>me</em> here!
The company came up three days ago for a fortnight. Your
old “Mother’s Son”. And a very fair play, though you <em>did</em>
write it. I saw in all the papers that you were coming home
and, though they didn’t give the name of the ship, I put my
pants on the <cite>Lithuania</cite>. Good old packet! Crossed on her
a dozen times! Now look here! You needn’t wait for the
tender; I’ve chartered a motor-launch, and we’ll be ashore
half-an-hour before the rest. I hope you’re in no hurry to
get back to town, because I’ve ordered a bite of lunch for
you at the Adelphi. One or two old friends... I’m
mightly glad to see you again, boy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He held out his hand a second time, and Eric took it with
the unwillingness of embarrassment. This triumphal progress
was well enough for America, but he could never live up
to it in England. A semicircle of fellow-passengers was
watching him, wide-eyed and envious, counting the telegrams
which he thrust half-read into his pocket and speculating
on the identity of Manders, who could play Marc Antony
or Louis Dubedat on the stage and never contrived, in
<span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'></span>private life, to look anything but a blend of pugilist, publican
and book-maker.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is the launch here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Right alongside, boy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric looked round and caught sight of Carstairs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I say, have you room for some friends of mine? Lord
John Carstairs is carrying a Foreign Office bag; if we can
get him ashore before the crowd... And Mr. and Mrs.
O’Rane.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was late afternoon before Eric found himself locked
into a reserved compartment with a dinner-basket, a bottle
of champagne and a box of cigars. As the train steamed
out of Liverpool, he drew his head in from the window,
wrapped a rug round his knees and went to sleep. There
seemed nothing else to do. He was still sleeping when he
reached Euston. A distracted mob burst from the train in
search of taxis, bending under suit-cases and wicker baskets.
Eric saw a liveried footman peering into carriage after
carriage.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. Eric Lane? I have a car here for you, sir.” He
walked five yards across the platform and entered Manders’
car. “If you’ll tell me what your luggage is, I’ll bring that
along, sir,” said the man.</p>

<p class='c009'>Still not more than half awake, Eric gave the address of
his club and sank shyly into a corner of the great limousine.</p>

<p class='c009'>Next day he resumed possession of his flat and sniffed
the vibrant air of London. The first bewilderment of the
armistice was yielding place to the excitement of the peace
conference and the coming general election. On one pretext
or another every second man in club, office and street was
escaping from England: an army of delegates was making
ready for Paris, a second army was assiduously securing
advantageous flats and rooms from which to direct the
deliberations of the plenipotentiaries. The restlessness
seemed greater than even in the first months of the war, and
<span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'></span>Eric was thankful for the fevered commotion. As Nelson
Millbank had predicted, there was as great a revolution in
turning soldiers into civilians as in turning civilians into
soldiers: much time must pass before they adapted themselves
to their new life. When the dust-clouds cleared away,
Eric would have made or found his niche and would no
longer have to drive in semiregal state or to slink through
the streets like a fugitive from justice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i>Welcome home expect you luncheon to-morrow Thespian
one-thirty Gaisford.</i>”</p>

<p class='c009'>The telegram was the first that Eric had opened on board;
it was duplicated to his flat, and, when he entered his club,
the squat, Bacchic figure of the doctor dominated the hall;
he was prepared on slight provocation to extemporize a party
of twenty-four, but, after a glance at Eric, he led him to
a table for two and pondered long over the bill of fare.</p>

<p class='c009'>When they had given their order, each waited for the
other to break silence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, how are you?,” asked the doctor at length, industriously
polishing his glasses. “You’re looking better than
I’ve seen you any time since you entrusted your valuable
young life to my care. For my private satisfaction—and
to please your mother—, I’d better run the rule over you—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t think I should escape that,” laughed Eric.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re not fit to look after yourself. You never were
and you never will be; and that, friend Eric, is apt to worry
your friends. I’ll tell you now, what I didn’t dare tell you
before, that it was touch and go whether your lungs would
hold out. They’re too valuable a part of the human body to
be neglected... What’s Japan like?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The same as anywhere else,” Eric answered with a shrug.</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor devoted a connoisseur’s scrutiny to the wine-list
before speaking again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose the English papers reached you?,” he asked at
length.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'></span>“I heard in Tokio.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was sorry, Eric, very sorry. But I’m glad it’s over.”
He hurried on remorselessly to cover the whistle of indrawn
breath. “It was killing you. Whether you’re wise to come
back so soon—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, my father’s been very ill,” Eric interrupted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was sorry to hear it. Are you going to stay in England?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gaisford attacked his luncheon and ate for some moments
without speaking.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is that prudent?,” he asked at length.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t suppose she’s very keen to meet me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor threw up his hands and shook his head ruefully.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, my friend! That’s where you’re wrong. And your
trade should have taught you better than that. A woman
doesn’t throw aside a man she’s fond of, a man who was
fond of her, if she can possibly keep him; it makes her feel
warm and comfortable to have him at call. Mark my words:
she’ll try to get you back! If her conscience is clear, she’ll
want to prove it’s clear; if her conscience is <em>not</em> quite clear,
she’ll never rest till she’s justified herself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric chewed his lips and looked away out of the window,
afraid to trust his own voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Marriage closes all accounts between us,” he muttered.
“I’m starting afresh, I’m not going to think about the past,
I’m going to <em>forget</em>... I wonder why she married George,”
he added inconsequently.</p>

<p class='c009'>“One woman in a hundred marries the man she wants,”
answered Gaisford; “the other ninety-nine look for some
one they can at least tolerate.” The bachelor’s love of generalizing
about marriage went swiftly to the doctor’s head.
“One man ripens the peach, and another always eats it....
Well, George has embarked on the great adventure with his
eyes open: every one knows that he wanted to marry Amy
<span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span>Loring, only she was a Catholic; the other woman he’s very
<em>fond</em> of, but she’s not the great love of his life. He felt it
was time to get married; it was a passionless, restful, convenient
marriage for both. Barbara’s last act of independence,
by the way, was formally to cut herself adrift from
her church....”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric felt that his friend was helping him to dismiss the
subject with an irrelevancy; but, for all his talk of forgetting,
he only wanted to fill in the blank pages of his tragedy.
None knew the whole truth. Even the actors were familiar
only with their own lines and scenes. Of the first act he
himself only knew that Barbara had played with Jack
Waring until he lost his head and embraced her faith in
the hope of marrying her: she continued playing until a panic
rush of superstition persuaded her that she had imperilled
Jack’s soul and must offer herself blindly in reparation....
He did not know why Jack had cast her aside after keeping
them both stretched on a rack for more than a year. And
Jack did not know that his best friend prayed nightly for
his death so that Barbara might be free to marry him. And,
with her wild haze of superstition and conscience, devotion
and vanity, passion and pose, no one could guess what Barbara
knew....</p>

<p class='c009'>A knot of members turned aside from the pay-desk and
came up with congratulations and welcome. Eric was
caught up and carried along with them until it was time
for him to return with the doctor and have himself examined.
That night he left London for Hampshire. The sight and
smell of Waterloo were a new and unexpected pain, for the
six-ten was a Winchester and Crawleigh train: Eric had
travelled by it a dozen times with Barbara and, though he
knew her to be away from London, he reconnoitred the
filling carriages as though he feared that she would spring
out and attack him. Once inside an empty compartment, he
hid behind his paper, refusing to look up when the door
<span class='pageno' title='50' id='Page_50'></span>opened and only rousing when a hand gently patted his knee
and Jack Waring’s voice enquired with surprise:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, Eric, old man, when did <em>you</em> get back? And what
sort of time did you have? D’you know I’ve not seen you
for nearly four and a half years? When I came home after
being a prisoner, I always missed you. Then you went off
to America... Tell me all about yourself, old son!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The voice was unmistakably cordial, and from Waterloo
to Winchester the two men discussed themselves and each
other. Jack Waring’s head-wound had incapacitated him
for work indoors; after a dozen failures he was abandoning
the bar and taking to horse-breeding in Worcestershire; two
friends, equally maimed by the war, were coming into
partnership with him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And there I propose to end my days,” he said. “Thirty-five’s
a bit old to be making a new start; but I’m alive, when
I didn’t expect to be, and that’s something.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric nodded and looked out of the window at the familiar
glimmering lights of south-west London. In different ways
but in equal measure Barbara had spoiled both their lives;
both must know it; and, now that she had left them for ever,
there was a dramatic fitness in their rebuilding an old friendship
out of their common experience and disaster. This was
the fourth act of their play; and, after the catastrophe, the
survivors could meet and prospect to see what remained...
In the gleaming mirror of the window, Eric studied the
reflection of his companion’s face; he was glad to hear that
Jack was going away to the other side of England; after
all, the old friendship could never be revived when one had
prayed aloud for the death of the other... He looked up,
startled and conscience-stricken; he had been mad, but it was
Barbara who made him mad, and Jack’s friendship was part
of the price which she exacted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve read all about you in the papers, of course,” said
Jack, “but I’ve not seen you in the flesh since the first months
<span class='pageno' title='51' id='Page_51'></span>of the war. Do you remember when you were ill and I
walked over to talk to you? I’d just got my commission.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I remember.” Eric mustered all his courage and plunged
before it had time to evaporate. “I’ve seen you once since—in
the distance. You and your father and mother and Agnes
came to a first night of mine—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Were you there?,” Jack asked in surprise. “I came up
on purpose to see you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Only for a moment. I’d been ill again and I was supposed
to be in bed. I saw the first act from a box, but I
couldn’t sit it out. You were all in the front row of the
stalls—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I remember it well.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric hurried on desperately:</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was almost your first public appearance since you got
back from Germany. Every one was congratulating you.
George Oakleigh... and Barbara Neave.” He paused,
but Jack’s face told him nothing. “They were there, I remember.
When I was in Japan, I saw that they’d married.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Nothing more was coming, and Eric was forced to admire
Jack’s restraint.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That was the last time I set foot in a theatre,” he ended
carelessly. “I suppose I shall have to begin again... I’ve
been ill off and on for some time, and it’s like making a new
start with me... By the way, I met Raney on the boat
from New York. D’you remember when you and I came
down from Oxford for the last time? I always felt the
night before was like a vigil. The dawn of a new life, a
new world...” His voice became wistfully reflective; but
Jack, as ever, prosaically declined to share his reverie. “It’s
easier to feel that at twenty-one than at thirty-five...”
Eric went on with a laugh. “But I suppose one must
try... When do you start for Worcestershire?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To-morrow. I’m only coming here to pick up clothes
<span class='pageno' title='52' id='Page_52'></span>and say good-bye. You know Agnes is married? And I
hear your sister Sybil’s engaged... I don’t suppose I shall
see you again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not at present, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They shook hands at Winchester, and Eric dawdled behind
to identify his luggage. He never wanted to see Jack again.
Sometime he must walk over to Red Roofs and pay his
respects to the family, but he would not go until Jack was
safely out of the way. If possible, he would avoid the
house altogether, for he never wanted to see Agnes since her
marriage. Five years earlier he had fancied that he would
like to make her his wife; in those days they would have
been very happy together; but Barbara had spoiled his
palate for other women....</p>

<p class='c009'>A car, driven by his sister, was awaiting him, and on the
familiar road out of the town, through the dripping Lashmar
Woods and across the water-logged common to the Mill-House,
he listened to tidings of the family. His father was
making an unexpectedly good recovery; his brother Geoffrey
was home on leave from the North Sea; Basil was on his
way from Salonica; Lady Lane, though worried and anxious,
was very well.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And what about you, Sybil?” Eric asked conscientiously.
The feeling which he had suspected in Tokio, when he received
the news of her engagement, returned to perplex and
oppress him; he was not interested in his family. “Tell me
about this man you’re marrying,” he added quickly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m very well, thanks. And very glad to see you again,
Ricky.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Her fingers slid down from the wheel and squeezed his
hand. Outward affection from one so undemonstrative as
Sybil was rare. Perhaps it was not wholly her pleasure at
having him back; he wondered how much they had heard
and guessed....</p>

<p class='c009'>The doors were thrown open at the first sound of the
<span class='pageno' title='53' id='Page_53'></span>horn, and Lady Lane stood silhouetted against the lemon
light of the hall with her husband beside her, leaning on her
shoulder. Eric hailed them and sprang out of the car,
sniffing the well-remembered scent of pine-logs and submitting
to a long inspection before he was allowed to take off
his coat. The house, low, warm and homely, was unchanged,
his mother was unchanged, the servants were unchanged;
Geoffrey came out of the library with his invariable, half-cleaned
gun under his arm and the inseparable retriever at
his side; only Sir Francis seemed older and more gaunt,
speaking a little indistinctly and glad of an arm when he
walked.</p>

<p class='c009'>After the triumphal send-off in New York, the splendid
isolation of the voyage and his reception in Liverpool, Eric
subsided gratefully into the tranquillity of Lashmar Mill-House.
Nobody here expected him to play a part, and he
could forget the war and put himself back seven years to
the time when he was an overworked journalist coming home
to sleep eighteen hours in country air, or fourteen years to
the time when he was an undergraduate returning across
country from Oxford, or twenty-five years to the time when
he was a schoolboy, first allowed to bring himself unaccompanied
from Broadstairs... He had promised Gaisford, he
had in effect promised O’Rane to forget all that had happened
since his first meeting with Barbara....</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll dine at once. Don’t wait to unpack or dress,” called
out Lady Lane as he ran upstairs to his threadbare, bleak
bedroom.</p>

<p class='c009'>Throughout dinner and the long evening which followed
he was kept talking of America and Japan. Sybil sat with
her hands clasped round her ankles, eagerly drinking in every
word; Geoffrey interjected lazy questions about New York
and San Francisco, Hawaii and Formosa; Sir Francis sat
lost in thought, hardly listening to what was said but proudly
conscious that Eric had won honour on three continents.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span>“Bed time! You must tell us the rest to-morrow,” said
Lady Lane, as the clock struck eleven.</p>

<p class='c009'>The three children were ready to protest, but she was
looking at her husband, whose eyes had closed. Sybil poked
the smouldering logs into safety; Geoffrey slipped an arm
through his father’s with a careless, “Going up, sir?” Eric
was left alone with his mother. He knocked out his pipe
and turned to her, with his eyes averted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, you must be worn out with all your travelling,” she
said, after a moment’s silence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m not very tired... The guv’nor’s better than I
expected, mother.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, the first days were the worst. I <em>had</em> to cable to you,
Eric. If anything had happened... I couldn’t take the
risk.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I’m very glad you did.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t <em>want</em> to bring you home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric found a particle of paper on the carpet. He picked
it up and carried it slowly to the fire.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You knew, then?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I guessed, darling.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You guessed I never meant to come back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hush, Eric... I guessed that you probably <em>felt</em> like
that. But I hoped that with time—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It gets worse every day! I’m waiting, listening for something
to go snap in my brain!”</p>

<p class='c009'>In body or nerves something “went snap,” and he plunged
forward, nearly throwing his mother off her balance. She
slipped her arm round his waist and walked slowly up and
down the room with him. At the door she paused and
noiselessly turned the key. He was shaking with dry sobs
which seemed to tear him in pieces, and she pulled his head
on to her shoulder, running her fingers through his hair and
once kissing his neck. Thirty years before she had lifted
him out of bed night after night, when he was crying with
<span class='pageno' title='55' id='Page_55'></span>pain, and walked up and down the nursery with him until
he dropped in her arms or fell asleep standing, with his head
on her breast.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ve grown so tall,” she whispered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Since...? I’m sorry, mother! It’s been such hell. I
<em>couldn’t</em> tell you before. That night, when you all came up
and dined with me and said good-bye... I meant to clear
out for good and all. When we had a submarine alarm, I
prayed that we should be torpedoed and sunk. And you
knew all the time?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I guessed a little bit. Mothers <em>do</em>, you know, darling
child....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It wasn’t her fault, mother,” said Eric with unsteady
emphasis.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’d always say that. But it’s over, Eric; have you
thought what you’re going to do now?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m afraid I’m rather damaged goods,” he sighed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Too bad to be mended?” She led him to a sofa and sat
down with his head on her shoulder and her arms round
him. “You’re dreadfully thin, Eric... And you’ve been
smoking too much. D’you see? Your fingers are all yellow...
Darling boy, I’m afraid you have to make
another effort, a big effort. Do you remember the doctors
gave you up three times before you were seven? And d’you
remember at Broadstairs, when you lived for eight months
on the verandah? I’m afraid we’ve given you all the brains
of the family and none of the constitution. But you’re not
going to give in now. Victory, Eric! This will be the biggest
of all... In time—”</p>

<p class='c009'>He broke away from her arms and buried his face in his
hands:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve had two years!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ll forget everything, if you can forget yourself. If
you could lose yourself altogether in work or in looking
after some one—”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='56' id='Page_56'></span>There was a single sob, and he had to fight for breath:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I used to walk up and down all night in front of her
house, when she was ill.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But that’s over. In time....”</p>

<p class='c009'>She rose and stirred the fire to a blaze.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In time...” Eric murmured. He did not want to look
after any one. Barbara had destroyed his faith in women.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It won’t be our first big fight, Eric. In a different way
I’ve been fighting all my life. Father. And you. And the
babies. And Sybil. I thought everything had come out
right, before the war; if you’d been a little bit stronger, Eric,
it would have been perfect. When the war came, it was a
bigger fight than I’d ever had. You were ill... and I
knew you weren’t happy. And anything might have happened
to Geoff and Basil. And then, of course, your father’s
illness....”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric slid on to the floor, resting his head against her knee
and gently turning her rings from side to side.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You don’t get much rest, mother.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m happier when I have one of you to look after.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I feel I’ve been such a brute to you all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps I understood... Eric, if you want to go
away again, I shan’t stop you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I’m going back to the old life. I must start work
again... and try to feel it’s worth doing. I <em>meant</em> to funk
it all, but now I’m determined to win... We won’t talk
about this again, mother. I don’t want you to think hardly
of her, and you must never let any one attack her... A
new life from to-day,” he ended jerkily. “Dawn....”</p>

<p class='c022'>“Eastward was the wise man’s course.... Mr. Polly saw himself
going along it with all the self-applause a wise man feels.
But somehow it wouldn’t come like that... the figure went
slinking... and would not go otherwise than slinking. He turned
his eyes westward as if for an explanation, and if the figure was
no longer ignoble, the prospect was appalling.</p>

<p class='c023'>“‘One kick in the stummick would settle a chap like me,’ said
Mr. Polly.</p>

<p class='c023'>“‘Oh, God!’ cried Mr. Polly, and lifted his eyes to heaven, and
said for the last time in that struggle, ‘It isn’t my affair!’</p>

<p class='c023'>“And so saying, he turned his face towards the Potwell Inn.</p>

<p class='c023'>“He went back, neither halting nor hastening in his pace after
this last decision, but with a mind feverishly busy.</p>

<p class='c023'>“‘If I get killed I get killed, and if he gets killed, I get hung.
Don’t seem just somehow...’”</p>

<div class='c024'><span class='sc'>H. G. Wells: “The History of Mr. Polly.</span>”</div>
<p class='c025'>“We should be so pleased if you could dine with us on
Friday,” said Lady John Carstairs on the threshold of the
O’Ranes’ house. “I never had an opportunity of thanking
you for your kindness in getting us off the boat so early. It
will be only a small party, but you’ll meet one or two friends
from America. I wanted to ask you before, but we’re only
now beginning to get our house straight.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric thought over the invitation in the moment allowed
him for consulting his engagement-book. He had intended
to begin work on a new play, but his friends and the strange
monster of an adoring public that he had conjured into existence
refused to leave him in peace. For a week after his
return to England the illustrated papers were publishing
photographs of him; four reporters called in two days to
learn his plans for the future and his impressions of
America; by letter and telegram he was begged to write and
<span class='pageno' title='58' id='Page_58'></span>speak on the fruits of his tour; and, when he had deflected
the applicants to the office of his agent, there remained private
appeals less easy to shelve or refuse. The dramatic
circle of the Thespian Club organized a dinner in his honour;
Dr. Gaisford bade him to “a strictly bachelor party” of his
friends and admirers; he was asked to take the chair for
the Actors’ Pension Fund; and the Penmen’s Club invited
him to be the guest of honour at their weekly luncheon.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mingled with the official invitations, the unofficial rained
down upon him. It was a repetition of the personal triumph
which he had enjoyed when his first play was produced.
Lady Maitland, Mrs. Shelley, Lady Poynter, Mrs. Manisty
and a dozen more urged him to lunch or dine with them;
war and peace made no difference to them, a man might
travel to the end of the world and back to find them still
chewing the cud of their sparse culture. If his position in
London three years before had been incredible even to him,
he was forced to believe now that his absence abroad had
mysteriously consolidated it: then the critics had bracketed
him with Pinero and Barrie for the excellence of his stagecraft
and with Shaw for the wit and virility of his dialogue,
in him they saw and blessed the promise of the future; now,
though he had written nothing in the interval, they chose
to regard the promise as fulfilled. “<i>Among the younger
playwrights</i>,” wrote the grudging editor of “Green-room and
Studio,” “<i>it is unsafe to predict who will step into the shoes
of the men we have named. Always excepting Mr. Eric
Lane, whose niche is assured to him...”</i> The public
seemed to take its time from the press; the enthusiasm of
those who knew him reacted on those who had yet to meet
him; and for a month he was whirled from house to house
in a sandstorm of adulation.</p>

<p class='c009'>When he could see and breathe again, Eric discovered gaps
in the well-remembered catalogue of names: Lady Crawleigh
and Lady Knightrider at least knew too much or suspected
<span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'></span>too much or had enough consideration not to ask him to
their houses; but Lady John Carstairs’ invitation was a test-case.
If he accepted, Eric was sure to meet other of Lady
Barbara’s relations there; but, even as he wavered, he knew
that he dared not surrender to shyness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should love to come,” he answered, as they went forward
to shake hands with their hostess.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. O’Rane was signalizing her return from America by
assembling all of her many friends who had resisted the lure
of the peace conference or the south of France. During the
war Eric had attended sufficient of her parties to recoil from
their noise and studied hilarity, but he was by now so much
sated with the pompous entertaining of such intellectuals as
Lady Poynter that he welcomed the informality of a Bohemian
frolic. Here at least he would be screened by the
shadow of some later and more modish celebrity. As he
came into the long, crowded library, a space was being cleared
in the middle; while their leader explored the quality of
the floor, a group of dancers with only their heads and ballet
slippers protruding from a swathing mass of cloaks and
shawls stood whispering in one corner. A tentative chord was
struck, the wrappings slid to the ground, and the dancers
pattered forward on tip-toe with their arms arched above
their heads.</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric was trying to see who was present when Amy Loring
came up with a radiant smile of welcome.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m <em>very</em> glad to see you again!,” she whispered. “Sonia
told me you’d crossed by the same boat, and I came here on
purpose to meet you. I do hope you’re quite strong again
now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve as clean a bill of health as our friend Gaisford is
ever likely to give me,” Eric laughed. For a moment he had
felt his muscles tightening in embarrassment and could only
think of a dinner at Lady Crawleigh’s house when Amy
had given him the same glowing smile of encouragement; she
<span class='pageno' title='60' id='Page_60'></span>had bathed in his happiness at being in love with her cousin
and had exhorted him to go on and prosper in disregard of
any obstacles that Barbara’s father might impose. Eric
wondered whether she remembered that night as vividly as
he did. Gaisford’s name touched another note in his brain,
and he remembered the doctor’s telling him that George
Oakleigh had once been in love with her; it was an old,
familiar tale, and, until a few months before, the gossips
had predicted that neither of them would ever marry. In
the act of wondering whether she felt any resentment towards
George or Barbara, Eric realized that she was too big
of heart to grudge happiness to any one. “I’m most awfully
glad to see you again!,” he added, unconsciously pressing her
hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>As they turned to watch the dancing, Eric recalled that he
had never before met Amy in the O’Ranes’ house. After
her brother’s jilting at Sonia’s hands, the two families had
found it more comfortable not to meet; they were apparently
now reconciled, and any one could choose between thinking
that they had drifted together in the irresistible crosscurrents
of London and imagining that the more generous
had made overtures of friendship. Behind the warmth of
her greeting Eric had fancied the diffidence of a suppliant,
as though Amy were offering him amends on behalf of all
her kin; he realized that he could, if he liked, live in retirement,
but that, if he came back to the old life, he must try
to shew as much graciousness and as little rancour as Amy
displayed towards those who fell below her own exalted
standard of chivalry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You don’t see a chair anywhere..?,” he heard her
murmuring.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why shouldn’t we stake out a claim at the supper-table?,”
he asked. “I was wondering if you were dining with the
Carstairs next week... Oh, well, don’t you think you
might get Lady John to invite you? It’s so very long since
<span class='pageno' title='61' id='Page_61'></span>I’ve seen you; and it’s impossible to talk here... London
hasn’t changed much in the last two years.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Or the last five. I wonder if we’re going <em>straight</em> back
to 1914... I’ve not been to a party of this kind since the
war. It’s not <em>very</em> amusing....”</p>

<p class='c009'>The scenes from the ballet were followed by a pianoforte
solo; Harry Manders poured forth a stream of stories;
Deganway gave imitations; and Pentyre accompanied himself
on a banjo, until a restless group headed by Gaymer suggested
clearing away the furniture for a dance. Eric, too,
was finding but little amusement in Mrs. O’Rane’s strenuous
programme and would have preferred to talk in peace
to Amy Loring or go home to bed. This, he decided,
would be the last party of its kind which he could spare
time to attend; for a moment he had wandered aimlessly
in the wilderness of London, waiting to light upon anything
that would occupy his thoughts. Nothing had come to him,
and he recognized that he must find his refuge in work.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m too old for this sort of thing,” he murmured to Amy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t remember ever being young enough,” she answered
with a smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>The heat and noise were by now almost unbearable; high
spirits were rising by imperceptible shrill stages to rowdiness;
and, as Gaymer’s deputation pressed insistently for its dance,
the older members of the party began to look at their
watches.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Anything you like, if you’ll only wait until every one’s
had something to eat—,” cried Mrs. O’Rane, leaving the
supper-table to pacify Gaymer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, they’ll go on all night, Sonia! We—want—a—dance.
Come on, Gerry, all together! Pentyre! One, two, three!
We—want—a—dance—We—want—a—dance.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The three men ranged themselves against a wall and
shouted through their open fists like trumpeting heralds.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the second repetition, those nearest to them joined in
<span class='pageno' title='62' id='Page_62'></span>the measured, relentless chorus, drowning the efforts of a
girl at the piano and reducing Mrs. O’Rane to helpless
gesticulation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wait till the end of this!,” she begged in an interval of
silence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We—want—a—dance!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But it’s so rude!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gaymer laughed and whispered to his companions.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do—not—shoot—the—pi-an-ist.—She—is—do-ing—her—best,”
rose the new chorus; then, with swelling menace,
“WE—WANT—A—DANCE.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was impossible to sing, play or argue against the concerted
uproar, and after a moment’s indecision Mrs. O’Rane
gave orders for the rugs and furniture to be moved. Her
husband apologized to the interrupted musician, and Eric
was leading Amy Loring away when Gaymer petitioned for
the first dance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lady Amy’s promised it to me,” Eric improvised.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The feller’s cut me out,” commented Gaymer with humorous
solemnity. “The next one, then?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Didn’t you ask me to find your car after that?,” Eric
enquired.</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Better go somewhere where I <em>am</em> wanted,” muttered
Gaymer. “No objection to my <em>asking</em>, was there? ’Hate
to give offence, you know. Nod as good as a wink, you
know. Pardon granted as soon as asked?”</p>

<p class='c009'>As they drove back to Loring House, Amy thanked Eric
for his intervention.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m afraid Johnny’s rather deteriorated since the war,”
she mused. “He was always rather wild, but he never used
to be rowdy. There was quite an unpleasantness at Kathleen
Knightrider’s last week; I believe she had to ask him to
go... If he’d only <em>drink</em> less....”</p>

<p class='c009'>When Eric arrived at Queen Anne’s Gate the following
week, he found that Lady John had conscientiously assembled
<span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span>a novelist and war-poet to keep him in countenance;
the “friends from America” were represented by Sir
Matthew and Lady Woodstock, an <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">attaché</span></i> from the embassy,
David O’Rane, his wife and Sir Matthew’s former secretary.
After that she seemed to have surrendered to her new family
by inviting the Duchess of Ross, Amy Loring and Phyllis
Knightrider; and, when Eric entered the drawing-room, she
cut short her welcome to tell the butler that Captain Gaymer
had asked whether he might dine and to order another cover
to be laid. The dinner promised to be peaceful and proved
so dull that Eric had to invent an excuse for leaving early:
he had now sketched the ground-plan of a new play and,
though he could as yet feel no enthusiasm for it, he conscientiously
tried to recover his old habit of regular work.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you’ll wait till half-past ten, we’ll drop you,” volunteered
Gaymer. “Ivy and I are going to a dance of sorts,
and I’ve chartered a taxi for the night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric remembered that it was raining, when he arrived, and
decided that his vague distaste for Gaymer’s society was
weaker than his dislike of wet pavements.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s very good of you,” he answered. “A taxi for the
night sounds luxurious.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Necessary,” answered Gaymer. “Can’t be bothered to
fight for the beastly things or walk home at three in the
morning. I can do without everything except personal
comforts. This fellow’s been ticking up tuppences ever since
Armistice Day; I suppose he’ll have to be paid some
time... ’Wonder if Amy’d like a lift.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As he crossed the room, Eric sat down in the empty chair
by Ivy Maitland’s side. It was ungracious to accept a favour
from a man and then, in the next breath, to disparage him;
but, after Gaymer’s unmannerly conduct at Mrs. O’Rane’s
party, any one might feel a little sorry to see Ivy becoming
his friend. Before the war he had been a leader in the
disorderly little group of roystering practical jokers headed
<span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span>by Jack Summertown and Pentyre; and, though the Air
Force had kept him employed for three or four years, he
seemed now to be casting about for fresh forms of dissipation
and rather aimless mischief. While Ivy was too young
and, at heart, too timid to amuse him for long, her behaviour
on the boat had been feather-brained; it was, of course,
their business, but Eric would have preferred to see her
with some one who checked her youthful craving for independence
instead of exciting it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where are you dancing?” he asked her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ssh! <em>Please!</em>,” she whispered. “I wish Johnnie hadn’t
shouted it out like that! Mother’d have a fit, if she knew I
was going to a dance alone.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric wondered for a moment whether she was yielding
to the youthful temptation of trying to shock him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your parents seem still to be a great trial to you,” he
observed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve made <em>some</em> impression on them. Johnnie’s got me a
job at the Air Ministry, and they’ve allowed me to take it.
The real fight’s coming when I tell them I’ve taken rooms
of my own.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you going to live alone?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think so. The girl who was coming with me has cried
off... Now, it’s no use finding fault with me, because
I’ve absolutely made up my mind. I <em>must</em> lead my own
life!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think it’s an awful mistake,” said Eric with a shrug.
“You’re much too young, much too good-looking...”
After saying good-bye at Liverpool, he had forgotten her
very existence; but in a short and flimsy blue dance-frock,
with blue stockings, shoes and head-band she was younger
and more provocative than he remembered either at their
first meeting in New York or on board the <cite>Lithuania</cite>.
“Girls of nineteen do <em>not</em> leave home and set up housekeeping
on their own,” he added.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='65' id='Page_65'></span>“But why shouldn’t they? I know several who do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was waste of breath to tell any one so superficially self-confident
that a girl of nineteen might need protection from
risks older and more insidious than she would deign to
admit. His eyes wandered for a moment to the corner
where John Gaymer was talking to Amy Loring; it was
hard for one man to say what attraction any other man
exerted over women, but Gaymer was undeniably popular;
without being handsome, he was more than presentable in
appearance, with an immaculate shell; the war had proved
his strength and reckless courage, and he comported himself
towards women with a devil-may-care assurance that occasionally
degenerated into a brutality which they did not
seem to resent. It was his business if he embarrassed himself
with Ivy Maitland’s adoration and hers if she chose to
fall in love with him... Eric tried to recall what he had
seen of their manner to each other: Gaymer had apparently
forced himself upon the party when he heard that Ivy was
dining, but this was perhaps no more than a convenient
means of meeting his partner before the dance; he had shewn
her only the boisterous attention that he held in readiness
for all women who would accept it; and, if they were in
love, neither would welcome a third person in the taxi....</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric’s attention was recalled to Ivy when he heard her
proclaiming rather petulantly:</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Somebody</em> must make a start.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ve not yet convinced me that you’ve any great hardships
to put up with at home,” he answered, with difficulty
suppressing a yawn.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They <em>aren’t</em> great. They’re small, absurdly small. But
they’re innumerable and everlasting. Now, take to-night.
When I met Johnnie last week at Mrs. O’Rane’s, we found
that we danced rather well together. He’s frightfully good
at games and everything—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you know anything about him?” Eric interrupted.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='66' id='Page_66'></span>“Not much. Do you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing at all. I’ve met him on and off for some years,
but in all the time I’ve never seen as much of him as I saw
of you that night in New York. On general principles, don’t
you think it’s—imprudent; aren’t your parents justified in
thinking it’s imprudent for you to tumble into an intimacy—not
with Gaymer, but with any man of whom you know
absolutely nothing?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But women have instincts about men! I should be no
better off if I dragged him away and introduced him to
mother and made her invite him to dinner. I daresay that’s
more conventional, but it doesn’t do any <em>good</em>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric hesitated long enough to ask himself why he inflicted
so much advice on a very raw child, but not long enough to
answer his own question.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It puts your relationship on a different footing,” he suggested.
“When a man’s been to your house and eaten your
salt, he feels a responsibility to the house. Look at it this
way: during the last week, how have you differed in essence
from—let me say—a chorus-girl who dines with a man and
goes to a dance with him and lets him help her to get taken
on at a new theatre? I don’t suggest that there <em>are</em> no differences,
but what differences are there for a man like Gaymer
to see?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ivy looked at him in perplexity which was too strong to
allow resentment to creep in.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t understand,” she said, and both were glad when
the taxi was reported to be at the door.</p>

<p class='c009'>As he read his letters and looked with distaste at the work
awaiting him on the morrow, Eric reviewed with morose
dissatisfaction the five weeks that had passed since his return
to England. He had sighed with boredom at the cultured
table of Lady Poynter; and in the conscientiously Bohemian
setting of Mrs. O’Rane the boredom had only been complicated
by amazement. (He scrawled a blue-pencil “Refuse”
<span class='pageno' title='67' id='Page_67'></span>across four invitations and tossed them into his secretary’s
letter-basket.) He had interested himself for a moment in
Ivy Maitland, at least to the extent of giving her some good
advice; but her pert assurance was a little tiresome, and he
was now only interested to wonder how soon John Gaymer
would weary of it. At the Mill-House he had tried to win
his way back to a place in his own family, but they had
mysteriously stood still and he had wandered into a spiritual
wilderness of his own. Even his work no longer promised
him a way out of the wilderness, but it might keep him from
brooding over the astounding emptiness of life.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had achieved a dull quiescence of spirit when he read
in Christmas week that Mr. and Lady Barbara Oakleigh
had returned to London from Ireland and were leaving
England for the Riviera after a few days in Hampshire.
That night, on his way to Winchester, Eric chose a compartment
at the back of the train to avoid all chance of meeting
her in the Crawleigh or Southampton coaches. His window
commanded two-thirds of the platform, and, five minutes
before the train was due to start, he caught sight of Oakleigh
and a footman hurrying by, with Barbara half a pace behind
him. Valentine Arden had christened her “the haggard
Venus”; her big sunken eyes and white cheeks had a morbid
fascination of their own, compelling as ever; physical delicacy
and nervous vitality still contended for possession of
her tall, wasted body; tragedy and defiance alternated in the
swift changes of her expression, as she flashed by the window
of his compartment. For all his resolution and training,
Eric felt his heart stop as it had stopped in Tokio, when he
read the news of her marriage; when the red mist lifted
from his eyes, he looked at her again from behind the screen
of his paper, surprised to see no change: the green morocco
travelling-cushion still bore the old “B.N.” in one corner;
he recognized her fur-coat, and George was carrying the
red leather jewel-case which he had carried for her fifty
<span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'></span>times. At their first meeting she had criticized his first play,
offering to re-write it, telling him that he knew nothing of
‘Life’ and proposing herself as instructor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, well... This is Life, I suppose,” Eric whispered
to himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>To have seen her would break the shock of meeting her
on her return to England, but he was glad that she was going
abroad; the shock would have to be broken by instalments,
widely separated, if he was to acquit himself without disgrace.
He wondered how much she had ever told her
husband. He wondered how much she dared admit to herself...
At Winchester he jumped on to the platform,
before the train stopped, and ran out of the station, before
any curious head could reconnoitre from the windows of
the Crawleigh and Southampton coaches.</p>

<p class='c009'>Finality... Eric turned up his collar and sank lower
in the seat of the car. He did not want Sybil to see his face.
Christmas Eve... Three years ago to a day he had
reached finality; Barbara was falling in love with him, when
she had sworn by the Cross to offer herself in reparation
to Jack Waring: and in those easy, sane, clear-cut days Eric
had decided to end their intimacy before either clouded it
with tragedy. And then she had appealed to his compassion
and sent for him... perhaps to see if he could continue
to resist her. And he had gone back; and his resistance had
broken down. A man only paid for his own weakness....</p>

<p class='c009'>But it was finality to see her running along the platform
arm-in-arm with her husband....</p>

<p class='c009'>“Basil’s home,” said Sybil, as they left the town. “He
got back yesterday and demobilized himself this morning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, good work! I’ve not seen him for three years.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s the first Christmas since the war that all three of you
have been home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>His two brothers had walked out to meet the car, and at
the sparse edge of Lashmar Woods they sprang out like
<span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span>highwaymen and secured themselves on the running-boards.
Lady Lane and her husband were waiting for them in the
hall, and, when they sat down to dinner, no one could believe
that they had been scattered for nearly five years. The
obliteration of time was all that Eric needed to complete his
sense of finality. For three days they talked and chaffed one
another, exhuming time-honoured jests and bandying stories
and experiences from four continents.</p>

<p class='c009'>Half-consciously Eric realized that he was reviving an
atmosphere of the past to avoid thinking of the future; but,
when each had told the tale of his wanderings, all looked
beyond the smoke and fire of the war to a world which might
be peaceful but would certainly be drab.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What are you going to do now, Basil?,” asked Eric at
breakfast on his last morning.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, if a grateful Government has kept open my job in
the India Office, I suppose I shall have to start in there—just
as if there’d been no jolly little war.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And I’m going back to the dear old China Station, just
as if there’d been no jolly little war,” added Geoffrey.
“Everything’s going to be rather flat... Hullo! Perfectly
good postman with Yuletide greetings for all of us!” He
bounded out of the room and helped in the sorting. “You’ve
got more than your fair share, Ricky.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You can have them all, if you’ll pay the bills,” answered
Eric. “Or I’ll pay the bills, if you’ll accept the invitations
and go in my place. Would you like to lunch with Lady
Poynter? Her husband had some marvellous port a couple
of years ago. Or dine with Mrs. Shelley? I can give you a
list of her <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">clichés</span></i>: a book always “creates an illusion” with
her, and modern poetry is “the pendant to a mood”. I can’t
<em>honestly</em> recommend her. Misguided women who think I
still dance... Or you may dine with Mr. Justice and
Lady Maitland; I don’t know them, but you’re sure to get
a good dinner, because their daughter says—here it is, if you
<span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span>don’t believe me—‘My father is so anxious to meet you.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sounds as if you’d been trifling with her young affections,”
said Geoffrey. “Take my advice and don’t go.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve no intention of going,” Eric answered. “I’ve work
to do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In the New Year he shut himself up with the first draft
of a play and for three months only left his flat for an hour’s
walk each day in the Green Park. Sometimes, as he sat
bent before his miniature theatre, marshalling, drilling and
dismissing his little card-board figures, he could fancy Barbara’s
eager, low voice at his side, her breath warm on his
cheek, and the keen, sweet scent of carnations once more, at
each lithe movement of her body, filling the room where in
other years she had argued out his plays line by line; sometimes,
as he read his speeches aloud, he caught himself
pausing for her judgement of their rhythm; and, when the
first rehearsal was called, he knew that he would find her
ghost sitting with clasped hands on a stool by his feet; on
the first night it would await him in his box, defying him to
bring any one else to a seat already taken.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But this is Life,” he whispered to himself. “I... I
told Gaisford I was going to forget about all this.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As soon as the new play was mentioned in the theatrical
gossip of the press, he received the usual appeals from unknown
men and women to be given a trial. As usual he sent
them bodily to Manders and, as usual, instructed his secretary
and servants to admit no one who called without a satisfactory
explanation. Manders hoped to begin rehearsing in
the late summer and to produce the play in the autumn;
Eric had too much other work on hand to waste his scanty
leisure on stage-struck amateurs; he had not seen a play
since his return to England and was beginning to forget the
highly-charged, conventionally unreal atmosphere of the
theatre.</p>

<p class='c009'>A week’s conscientious study of contemporary drama
<span class='pageno' title='71' id='Page_71'></span>satisfied him that, whatever else the critics might say of “The
Gate of Horn”, they would not degrade it by comparison
with any of the plays that he had felt constrained to see. On
the last night of his penance he was escaping into the Strand
from the unknown people who persisted in bowing to him,
when a girl, standing by herself a few paces ahead, turned
carelessly and bade him good-evening in a diffident and
rather surprised voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m afraid I can’t see who it is,” Eric had to confess.
“I’m as blind as a bat, when I come out of a theatre.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s Ivy Maitland. You wouldn’t remember me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed I do. Are you all by yourself?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes. I came with a man, but he—he had to go before
the end.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you must let me see you home,” said Eric after a
moment’s hesitation which he hoped she would not notice.
“It’s the Cromwell Road, didn’t you tell me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not now. I—in spite of your advice... I really
couldn’t stand it any longer at home. But you mustn’t come
out of your way; I’m only a step from here—at the back
of the Adelphi.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let me see you as far as the door... Well, I hope it’s
a success.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They crossed the Strand and dived through a hidden courtyard
and down a flight of steps before she answered:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t say it is—so far.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come! that’s honest!,” said Eric. “If you’ve the moral
courage to admit it’s a failure, why don’t you have the
greater moral courage to chuck the whole thing up?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! I can’t do that.” She stopped in front of a door
and felt for her latch-key. “I suppose you wouldn’t come
in, if I asked you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric pretended to look at his watch and even walked away
to the nearest lamp-post, where he looked at it again. He
<span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'></span>had still two hours’ work to do, but the girl’s dejection of
voice and her candid admission of failure touched him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you all alone?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes. You won’t compromise <em>me</em>; and I shouldn’t mind
if you did,” she added with a touch of her old impatience.
“I was thinking of you. You’re so well-known—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you’re all by yourself... <em>I</em>’m thinking of <em>you</em>—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, I was afraid you wouldn’t come!”</p>

<p class='c009'>She sighed gently and held out her hand. Loneliness and
the sense of failure seemed to have taken away all her
vitality: her hand was cold and limp, and her head drooped
as though she lacked the strength to keep it erect.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let me come to tea some day,” Eric suggested.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, you’re too busy. It wouldn’t be fair.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m not too busy for that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Aren’t you?” She made a pitiful attempt to collect the
fragments of her pride; but the drooping head and unsteady
lips belied the valiance of her voice, and haughtiness passed
quickly into petulance. “You were too busy to dine with us,
when I invited you; you were too busy to see me when I
called on you, too busy even to answer my letter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric stared at her in amazement:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Miss Maitland, I simply don’t understand! I couldn’t
dine with you, because I never dine out when I’ve a play on
hand. But the call and the letter—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your maid said you couldn’t see me, as I hadn’t an appointment.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I must apologize for her. She probably thought you’d
come to ask for an engagement.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I had. And that’s what I wrote about. You said in
New York that I might come to you for help; I couldn’t go
to your club, because father’s a member. Didn’t you get
my letter?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If it had anything to do with the theatre, I don’t suppose
I finished it; all those things are sent on to Manders. I’m
<span class='pageno' title='73' id='Page_73'></span>sorry, Miss Maitland; I wouldn’t have disappointed you for
the world.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I began to feel desperate,” she answered dully. “It
seemed needlessly unkind. Of course, I ought to have
known that you were very famous—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Please! I’ve apologized. I hoped I’d cleared myself.
Won’t you choose your own time for coming,—if you think
I can do any good?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She swung her latch-key reflectively and then touched his
arm with her fingers.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Won’t you come in—just for a moment?” she pleaded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m thinking of you,” he repeated.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ll do me more good by coming in for five minutes
than by thinking of my reputation... I’m desperate.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s the second time you’ve used that word; you
oughtn’t to know the meaning of it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, if you come in, don’t treat me like a child.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric followed her into a narrow, ill-ventilated hall, lighted
by a pin-point of gas. The house was old and full of half-heard
noises and dry, distant scents; the first floor was let
to a solicitor, the second to a dramatic agent; above that was
a double flat and at the top, crushed squat under the roof
and pared by sloping ceilings, Ivy Maitland’s own roomy
attic. As she turned up the gas, he saw a round table and
wicker chairs, a piano and book-case and, in an alcove, a
cupboard, bed and chest of drawers. While she slipped off
her cloak and pulled the curtains over the alcove, he read the
titles of the books and glanced at the photographs on the
piano. The place of honour was given to an officer in the
uniform of the Air Force, and Eric guessed its identity
almost without looking at the face or at the “Yours always,
John Gaymer,” scrawled across one corner.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Won’t you sit down? It’s a miserable fire, I’m afraid,”
she apologized, dropping on to her knees and battering unscientifically
with a bent poker on the top of three sadly
<span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span>smouldering lumps of coal, each too big for the tiny grate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m not cold, thanks... How long have you been in
these quarters?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Two months.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And who looks after you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A woman comes in and cooks my breakfast and cleans
the place. I usually have my other meals out.” Eric was
not conscious that his expression had changed, but the girl
looked up piteously and turned away to the fire. “Don’t look
so disapproving! I’m not defending myself!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear child, I’m not attacking you. Haven’t I come
here solely to find out if I can be of any assistance to you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She jabbed at the fire in reflective silence, and Eric, watching
her through half-closed eyes, seemed to see rippling
waves of unhappiness, disappointment, loneliness and discomfort
rising until they submerged her and she ceased to
struggle. She was white and tired; her arms were thin and
her shoulder-blades sharply outlined under the green gauze
of her dress, as she stolidly poked the fire and refused to
look at him. The air of assured efficiency which she had
worn in New York never seemed more than the assertive
protest of extreme youth against patronage; her abandonment
of it now suggested that she habitually attacked and
then ran away, first disregarding advice, then admitting her
mistake where a stronger woman would have converted it
into success and where a prouder woman would have preserved
silence. Perhaps it was too much to expect great
strength or pride in a girl of nineteen whose head was still
fermenting with unassimilated catch-words.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was very good of you to come. And it was awful
cheek of me to ask you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Imagine—for one night—that I’m quite human,” Eric
suggested.</p>

<p class='c009'>She jumped up and ran to the door.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’d like a drink!,” she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='75' id='Page_75'></span>“Is that the differentia of the human man?” he laughed.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a clink of glasses outside, and she returned with
a bottle of brandy and a box of cigars. While he was mixing
himself a drink, she slipped with apparent aimlessness
behind him, and he heard something drop. When he looked
round, the signed photograph of John Gaymer had disappeared,
and she was holding out a tumbler for him to fill.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m not going to give you brandy,” he said, picking up
the syphon of soda-water.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just a little! I’m so tired.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not a drop! If you start drinking brandy at nineteen—because
you’re tired—, where d’you think you’ll be at
thirty?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t much care!” she answered. “I believe those
cigars are quite good. Won’t you try one?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not if you’re going to sleep in this room, thanks,” he
answered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t mind it—honestly,” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“As a matter of fact I’ve been smoking all day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric composed himself as comfortably as possible in a
room where everything jarred upon him. She ought not to
have been living there by herself, she was lonely, uncomfortable
and probably ill-fed; she ought not to allow a man
to come and see her, she ought not to dream of drinking a
brandy and soda, she ought not to have brandy or cigars in
the house, she ought not to know that she did not mind inhaling
cigar-smoke in her sleep. The incident of the photograph
recurred to his mind, and he wondered whether he was
being offered refreshment which she had provided for Gaymer...
and whether she had dropped the photograph behind
the piano because she was ashamed of him... or
whether they had quarrelled, whether it was Gaymer who
had taken her to the theatre and abandoned her....</p>

<p class='c009'>“I haven’t seen you since that night at the Carstairs’,” she
began. “You remember?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'></span>“When I gave you good advice. Yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I tried to follow it. I’m not altogether a fool and,
thinking it over, I thought I saw what you meant. After
the dance Johnnie asked me to go to another... It was
very hard to do, but I tried to let him see that, though it was
all <em>right</em>, of course... I invited him to come and dine with
<em>us</em>. That was what you wanted, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thought it was better, certainly. Though, why you
think my advice—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because you know about things, you’re clever, you’ve
met everybody, you can understand people and write about
them. Father’s in such a rut... Well, Johnnie came.
That was when I wanted you to meet him. He wasn’t much
of a success, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What happened?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I don’t know! He <em>argued</em>... and father always
expects an enormous lot of deference from boys. Father
said afterwards that Johnnie had drunk much too much for
a young man and had become very impertinent. After
that, of course, he wasn’t invited again, and mother kept
nagging and trying to make me give up my job in his office.
We had an awful row one day, just because I dined with
Johnnie and came back rather late after the theatre. Father
said I wasn’t to go out with him and that, as long as I lived
at home, he expected me to obey him. I decided that I
couldn’t live at home any longer. Johnnie found me these
rooms....”</p>

<p class='c009'>She coughed and took a sip of her soda-water.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You consulted him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes. He made me see that the only thing to do was to
leave home....”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric sat suddenly upright and then relaxed to his former
attitude, noting with quick thankfulness that his movement
had been unobserved.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What made you write to me?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span>“Well, you see, everybody in my department is being demobilized,
so I wanted a job. I saw you had a new play—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Already cast,” Eric interrupted. “And we could cast
the third footman five times over with people who’ve played
respectable parts for years. There’s nothing there, Miss
Maitland, I’m afraid. Even if there were, I’d sooner see
you living with your parents again—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t go back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I see. Well, what are you living on?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I saved a little money when I was with Sir Matthew.
When that’s gone—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Gaymer would see you didn’t starve or get turned
into the street,” said Eric with soft irony.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes. At least he said he would—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Before you quarrelled,” he suggested.</p>

<p class='c009'>She looked at him wonderingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who told you we’d quarrelled?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You did. Miss Maitland, however unconventional you
want to be, you can’t take money from a man. I’d most
gladly lend or give you fifty pounds to-night, but you couldn’t
possibly accept it. You see that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course! I hardly know you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric shook his head in bewilderment, as he tried to determine
whether she was naturally stupid or wholly unsophisticated.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you in love with Gaymer?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ivy hesitated before answering, and Eric felt that he was
not going to hear the truth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I like him when he’s nice to me,” she answered indifferently.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is he in love with you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He likes me. He likes so many people,” she said, as
carelessly as before.</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric nodded slowly and held out his hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, good-night. I’ll do what I can.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='78' id='Page_78'></span>Though he could promise her little, she was better for the
companionship and talk. In opening the door, he turned
and saw her watching him; but now she was spiritless again,
her hands were clasped in front of her, her shoulders were
bowed, and she looked crestfallen, limp and fragile. Remembering
how irritation at her pertness had warmed to
impatient dislike on board the <cite>Lithuania</cite>, Eric blamed himself
for intolerance towards a child whose worst crime was her
childishness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have you a telephone here?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s one downstairs that I use. Shall I shew you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no, thanks.” Impulse sent him back into the room;
and he shook hands with her again, as though to postpone for
an instant the silent chill of loneliness which he could feel
already settling upon her. Gaymer had contrived to make
the girl uncommonly miserable; and, though unhappiness was
a universal distemper of the soul, though Eric had told himself
that Ivy’s relations to Gaymer were their own business,
he knew that he could comfort her spirit by putting an arm
round her thin shoulders, by kissing her forehead and allowing
her to sob out her simple perplexity and pain of heart.
A hundred anguished memories warned him of the price
that he had already paid for compassion; common sense
cried out that this was not his affair. And yet, unless he
made it his affair, no one would; and he had now learned
wisdom and knew where to stop. “What I meant was: if
you ever feel lonely, ring me up and have a talk. I’m nearly
always at home, night and day. I’m not too busy for that.
Suggest a day for lunch. I lead a fairly solitary life myself.”</p>

<p class='c020'>“<i>Can you spare a moment to see me some time? You may
remember Mrs. O’Rane’s party and a young man whom we
agreed not to like. I want to find out all I can about
him....</i>”</p>

<p class='c009'>Amy Loring lay in bed, frowning over Eric’s note and
weaving interpretations of its discreet brevity. After telephoning
to invite him to tea, she read the letter again with
mingled curiosity and misgiving. Obviously the man in
question was John Gaymer; no less obviously John Gaymer
had been up to mischief. It was not easy, however, to
establish a connection between him and Eric, unless he had
been up to mischief with the little Maitland girl; Amy had
overheard enough of a conversation between them at the
Carstairs’ dinner to realize that a certain intimacy existed;
and she had not failed to detect in Eric at least a paternal
attitude towards a girl whose eyes just perceptibly brightened
when he spoke to her.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the course of the morning she contrived a meeting with
Gaymer’s aunt Lady Poynter; encountering Lady Maitland
at luncheon, she mentioned Ivy’s name and returned home in
time for tea with a collection of opinions which crystallized
in the vigorous statement that Mr. Justice Maitland was a
fool, Gaymer a cad and Ivy a child whom one had not seen
since she was a baby.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='80' id='Page_80'></span>“What is it, exactly, that you want to find out?,” asked
Amy when Eric arrived.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hardly know... I’ve met this girl half a dozen times;
she’s a nice child, but rather impulsive and very easily led.
She’s not happy at home, and I fancy she’s allowing Gaymer
to lead her... Let me put it this way: if she were your
sister, would you entrust her to him with an easy mind?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Amy shook her head emphatically:</p>

<p class='c009'>“No! I daresay I’m old-fashioned... Mr. Lane, I’m
waiting for a hideous scandal—not with her, poor child, but
with all these girls who’ve broken away from home during
the war, all the men too, who’ve been allowed so much
liberty with girls that they’ve lost the old reverence that men
like you or my brother Jim had. The parents are to
blame—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But the children suffer,” Eric interrupted. “That’s an
epitome of the world’s history. And it’s equally true if you
put it the other way round... But what are we to do with
this girl?”</p>

<p class='c009'>A fleeting glance at Eric’s worried eyes told her that he
was less concerned for the world’s history of suffering than
for Ivy’s immediate welfare; his use of the plural shewed
that they were to be joined in a common rescue; and her
mind, seizing the possibility that Eric might be in love,
bounded forward to consider whether he should be helped to
fall deeper in love with a girl who possessed superficially
little more than the daintiness and intoxicating lure of
adolescence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell me about her,” she suggested. “I should like to
help if I could.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric described their fragmentary conversation in New
York, on the <cite>Lithuania</cite>, at Lady John Carstairs’ and in Ivy’s
attic behind the Adelphi, adding guesswork sketches of the
establishment in the Cromwell Road with an unsympathetic
father and a helpless mother. Neither the range of his
<span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span>information nor his manner of giving it betrayed any great intimacy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Has she any other relations?,” asked Amy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Two brothers—demobilized and back at Cambridge—we
can rely on them, I suppose, to intervene with the usual
horse-whip, if things go too far—; and two sisters who’ve
married and shed all responsibility... Perhaps you wonder
what <em>I’m</em> doing—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s very natural. She’s an attractive child.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m not in love with her or anything of that kind. I
don’t think she’s in... <em>danger</em>, but I’d do anything to keep
her from being vulgarized.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Amy busied herself with the tea for a few moments.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think she’s a little bit in love with you...” she ventured,
when she had given his momentary warmth time to
pass away. “Oh, tiny things that only a woman sees. She
admires you enormously; and she’s flattered that you take
an interest in her. That strengthens your position.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I don’t want to mix myself up in it,” cried Eric impatiently.
“One can’t altogether stand aside... Everybody’s
business is nobody’s business, and that girl <em>needs</em>
some one to take an interest in her. As she doesn’t get on
well with her parents, I was wondering if her aunt could be
persuaded to take charge of her. All this revolt of the
young girl is rooted in boredom; it’s the descent of Nemesis
on the Cromwell Road. If Connie Maitland gave her a
good time and introduced her and let her see that people
would simply cut her if she went off on her own, she’d soon
drop this aspect of provincialism. Can’t you play on her
vanity? A girl like that would much sooner be a success in
society than a rebel against society; she’d sooner marry the
second cousin of a baronet than live with the greatest poet
or painter of all the age... That’s the object of my call.
Forgive me for boring you like this!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='82' id='Page_82'></span>“You haven’t bored me. I took quite a fancy to her. I’ll
see what I can do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric left the house with relief that he had transferred to
other shoulders the responsibility for Ivy’s welfare. From
the library window Amy watched his thin figure striding
away, with what she chose to construe as rapid purposelessness,
until it disappeared round the corner of Clarges Street;
for Ivy’s sake it was worth her while to take a little trouble,
and, if Eric were truly in love with her, she would take very
great trouble indeed; but that, she decided, she would not
know until she saw how impatiently he came to enquire what
was being done. For all she knew, he was befriending Ivy
from vague good nature—as she was befriending him—;
Eric was one of the men for whom most women felt a mild
and transitory tenderness because he was nearly always too
much preoccupied to be aware of it.</p>

<p class='c009'>When she had put herself in communication with Lady
Maitland, Amy waited for another visit from Eric, but for
several weeks he was too busy with his play to think about
Ivy; and, as she did not avail herself of his general invitation
to lunch with him, he could only assume that her position
was no more “desperate” than before. A month after
his call at Loring House, Amy took the initiative and wrote
to say that the judge had gone away on circuit and that his
sister-in-law was to take charge of Ivy until her father’s return,
when the position could be reconsidered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think she’ll behave sensibly and go back home,” Amy
added when they met one night at Lady Poynter’s. “Ivy
and I have become great friends; and I’m sure that John
Gaymer was at the bottom of the trouble. First of all he
flattered her and dared her to break loose; then he neglected
her, then he made a fuss of her, then he roused her
jealousy. After that he could do what he liked with her.
But I’m thankful to say that he’s sheered off now, and you
can rely on Connie to give her other things to think about.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='83' id='Page_83'></span>Eric looked thoughtfully across the room to the corner
where Mrs. O’Rane and Gaymer were talking in whispers.
Throughout dinner Lady Poynter, whose latest intellectual
relaxation was in the works of Freud and Jung, had been
interpreting all human relationships in terms of psycho-analysis;
adopting her language, Eric found that all this remote,
whispered discussion of Gaymer had created a fantastic
image of a man sinister and dissolute, bearing on his
face the stamp of evil passions and the ravages of debauchery.
False images, Lady Poynter explained with annihilating
sweeps of a massive arm, could only be corrected
or dispelled by contact with reality. It was a relief and a
disappointment to Eric that he could detect no change in
form and features which always seemed to have been cut by
a machine; Gaymer was powerfully built with sturdy limbs,
broad shoulders and back, a muscular neck and big-boned
wrists and hands, the whole so well proportioned and knit
together that his true height and breadth were unsuspected.
In face, manner and dress he had set himself to be conventional
to the verge of commonplace. His hair, black and
straight, was cut, oiled and brushed back from the forehead,
as though straight black hair could be treated in no
other way; his blue Air Force uniform, vividly new and
well-fitting, was built and worn unremarkably but with a
suggestion that it could not be worn otherwise. He moved,
smiled and spoke as if he were trying to suppress all personal
characteristics; and everything about him was ready-made
except his clothes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric pretended to be judicial when he knew that he was
on the look-out for faults; but there was no fault to find,
unless a man was to be hanged for impatiently lighting a
cigarette while waiting for dinner—and Mrs. O’Rane began
to smoke before the fish-plates had been taken away—;
these were war-manners. Eric watched and listened; but,
like the others of his set, Gaymer talked like a gramophone
<span class='pageno' title='84' id='Page_84'></span>and thought not at all. Failing to condemn, Eric tried to
appreciate; but Gaymer’s exasperating suppression of personality
left nothing to admire. The set had agreed to put
on humorous Cockney records; Mrs. O’Rane and Gaymer
were improvising a duologue to represent one shop-girl
bidding another good-bye at a station, and fragments of
their speech floated across the room to mingle incongruously
with Lady Poynter’s undefeated exposition of psycho-analysis:
“I <em>should</em> ’a thought A Certain Person would ’a
come and seen you off, dearie...” “Ow, ’e knows, when I
want ’im, I’ll send for ’im; <em>and</em> not before. You <em>will</em> write,
dearie? I love letters. And you’ll send my washing on;
I’m in me old lodgings”... “You won’t be ’ungry, missing
tea and all?”... “Thenks, I ’ad a nice bit of cold fish
before I started....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I <em>don’t</em> see the fascination,” Eric murmured, turning
away after a last look at Gaymer. Any other healthy animal
in good condition, well washed and groomed, enjoying his
food and drink, would be as attractive.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps it’s—impersonal,” Amy suggested. “I’ve been
trying to make out why so many girls marry in such a
hurry. Partly it’s instinct, of course, and partly it’s just
recklessness; when your husband might be killed any moment,
it didn’t much matter who you married. But far more
often, I’m sure, girls marry something symbolical in a man
rather than the man himself. They see a man in a top
hat, and he’s nothing in particular; they hear of him doing
something wonderfully brave, and he’s a very different
person to them; he’s a hero, he’s been fighting, while they—with
perhaps just as much bravery—can’t use it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They marry the sex and not the individual,” Eric suggested.</p>

<p class='c009'>Amy nodded and looked across the room as though to
contrast Ivy’s youth with her own grave maturity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, and in twelve or fifteen years’ time, when she’s my
<span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span>age, she’ll know that it doesn’t matter what a man <em>represents</em>
symbolically or what he <em>is</em>. But what he <em>will</em> be, how he’ll
wear....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I believe Gaymer was incredibly brave until his smash,”
said Eric.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And never really sober from one week’s end to another.
He must have a wonderful physique... That’s another
thing: I wonder how much of the immorality and unhappiness
of the present-day is caused by a sort of shell-shock.
It’s a great excuse; it may also be a reason... Have you
seen Ivy since our talk?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, but I believe we’re to meet on the opening night of
the opera.”</p>

<p class='c009'>When Eric entered Lady Maitland’s box the following
week, he found Ivy recovered from her melancholy and
pleasurably excited by the amusement and occupation which
her aunt was contriving as a means of shewing her that,
whatever changes the war had effected and whatever
“those freakish people in Chelsea and St. John’s Wood”
might do, it was social outlawry, self-imposed, for a girl of
her age and position to live alone; and it was a pity to be
outlawed before she knew anything of the life to which she
was saying good-bye.</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric participated in the conspiracy to the extent of conducting
Ivy round the house in the second <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entr’acte</span></i>. Though
most of the singers were new to London, Covent Garden
had regained very much of its old appearance. War, indeed,
and the passage of five years had expunged some well-known
names from the box doors; Bertrand Oakleigh’s
place was taken by a war contractor, the double box in which
Sir Deryk Lancing used to sit restless and alone, half-hidden
by the curtains, had passed to Lady Poynter. But, though
new names were occasionally seen and certain old names had
taken on a British ring, the changes were inconsiderable.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span>“Is there any one you’d like to call on?,” he asked Ivy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I haven’t seen any one I know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re to be envied.” Eric bowed vaguely and found
himself caught up by three different women in as many
minutes. “Let’s go back,” he suggested, as he took off the
last of them. “I’m tired of telling people that I’m too busy
to lunch out; and, though I hate work, I think it’s preferable
to the average luncheon-party.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He picked up his opera-glasses and began identifying and
describing to her the occupants of the other boxes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If <em>I</em> had genius—,” Ivy began diffidently.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I haven’t, Miss Maitland,” he interrupted. Adulation
was at any time a weariness, and he had not undermined
her alliance with Gaymer in order to attract her to
himself. “You mistake fashion for fame. I’ve written half
a dozen successful plays... I’m glad to see you here to-night.
This is a better frame for you than a garret behind
the Adelphi.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ivy left the challenge where it lay.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve never been to the opera before,” she said. “I shall
come as often as Aunt Connie has room for me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So shall I,” answered Eric, “whenever she or you invite
me. That’s one of the few things I’m <em>not</em> tired of.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was only when he had found Lady Maitland’s car for
her and sent Ivy home in it that he recalled his own words
and wondered whether she was reading an unintended enthusiasm
into them. Her big grey eyes seemed startled
when the lights were turned on at the end of the third act;
and, though she said nothing, he felt their light upon him.
They were still startled at the opera’s end and looked over her
shoulder at him, as he helped her into her cloak. When they
said good-night, she drew away her hand as though his
touch sent a shock through her body, but she was turning to
see the last of him as the car glided away from the door.</p>

<p class='c009'>During the next fortnight Eric received three invitations
<span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span>by telephone and two by letter; but he recalled Amy
Loring’s hint and determined to avoid that one box until
Ivy had lived down any suspicion that she was in love with
him; he excused himself until he felt that Lady Maitland’s
friendship hung by a thread and then chose a night when
<cite>Louise</cite> was being played and he could come late and leave
early. As he walked upstairs, the shrill laughter of the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">atelier</span></i> scene warned him that the second act was not yet
over, and he crept down again to finish his cigar in the hall.
He was reading the list of box-holders for the night, when
a voice behind him said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hul-<em>lo</em>! When did <em>you</em> get back from America?”</p>

<p class='c009'>George Oakleigh was standing at his elbow, unembarrassed
and cordial, waiting to shake hands with him. Eric
was conscious only of an immense, sudden appeal to his own
strength of heart and nerves; his eyes had taken in George
and his expression at a glance; Barbara was almost certainly
with him; and with another glance, not hurried enough
to seem apprehensive, he saw her three yards away, speaking
to Mrs. Shelley. He had taken in all that he needed,
before George was ready for an answer. Unchanged; tall
and slender; in a silver sheath of a dress; with a black
head-band and a bouquet of the white carnations that she
always brought him when he was ill; a white Indian shawl,
embroidered with green and red parrakeets, which he had
seen her wear a dozen times. All the blood in his body
seemed to rush to his eyes, and he felt himself rocking.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I got back a fortnight after the armistice.”</p>

<p class='c009'>His voice was detached from him, but, though it came
from an unguessed distance, he could hear that it was steady.</p>

<p class='c009'>And then it was time for his own question:</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ve been on the Riviera, haven’t you?” It was a
triumph to meet and overcome “Riviera” without a stammer.
“Lucky man! We had the wettest winter on record here...
George, I hope it’s not too late to offer you all good wishes.
<span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span>I was in Japan, when I heard about it; I meant to write, but
I was suddenly called home to my father and I thought I
should arrive before the letter... I crossed with Raney,
by the way... Like me, I see you only come for the third
act of <cite>Louise</cite>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I’m rather tired of the rest. I suppose this means
that the second act’s just over.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Two sluggish streams were trickling out of the stalls and
down the stairs, converging by the open doors. Dr. Gaisford,
heading the first, looked round, nodded to George and
walked over to a sofa, where he perched like a fat, blond
idol; it was a perfect opportunity for Eric to break away
and join him, but he knew that this first meeting with Barbara
must be faced and endured.</p>

<p class='c009'>She brought her conversation to an end at last and looked
round for her husband.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, how do you do?” she said to Eric.</p>

<p class='c009'>Even through a glove the touch of her hand was unmistakable.
If he did not meet her for twenty years, he could
never forget it; if he were blind, he would still know it
from any other woman’s. He had kissed it a thousand
times, kissed every finger of it; when he was ill and she
came to sit with him, it had lain coolly over his eyes, charming
him to sleep; at the first night of the “Bomb-Shell”,
when the success of the play hung in the balance, he had
gripped it until a ring cut into her finger. He wondered how
much she remembered, could not help remembering....</p>

<p class='c009'>“How do you do?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She smiled as she had smiled in saying good-bye to Mrs.
Shelley, with a regrouping of lips and cheeks. It was a
smile in which her eyes played no part; they told him
nothing. She was as much collected as he knew she would
be, equal to every social demand and blankly without emotion.
She was neither tender nor hard, neither ashamed nor
<span class='pageno' title='89' id='Page_89'></span>defiant; and, though she too must have rehearsed this meeting,
her eyes looked at him without even curiosity.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was already trembling in reaction before she passed
out of sight. He could not trust himself to light a cigarette;
and he was thankful for the press of people who gave him
time for recovery as he threaded his way to Gaisford’s sofa.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What d’you think of it?,” he asked, carelessly enough.
“I’ve only just come.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, it’s good. Ansseau’s marvellous, and Edvina’s singing
very well, though I’d always sooner hear her in Tosca
than in anything. She’s worked that up wonderfully since
the first time it was put on. I haven’t seen you here before.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I came to <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bohème</span></i> the first night. Not since... But I
intend to be here as often as I can spare the time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Dr. Gaisford offered him a cigarette, wondering idly why
a man whose trade was in words allowed himself to say
“intend” when he could have used “hope” or “expect” without
betraying himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, you’re wise... if you feel equal to it,” he said
bluntly. “Was that the first time you’d seen her since her
marriage?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The first time to speak to,” said Eric, trying to control
his voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It will get easier by degrees,” said the doctor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll hope so.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bad as that, old man?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was hell!” Eric whispered. “Either she never <em>had</em> a
soul, or she’s lost it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, my dear boy—”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric interrupted him with a mirthless laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I’m sure you’re right!,” he cried. “But I wonder
if you ever appreciate how little good it sometimes does to
be right... I must go, or Lady Maitland will be fuming.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He jumped up and hurried through the hall and up the
<span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'></span>stairs. The first name to meet his eyes was “George Oakleigh,
Esq.” but the door was mercifully shut and he strode
past it and worked his way through an argumentative circle
into Lady Maitland’s box. She was sitting with her husband
and Ivy, and he was almost glad to be distracted by
her reproaches for arriving so late.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll make up by leaving early,” he suggested. “Age cannot
wither the infinite tedium of the fourth act.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, you must stay till the end. Maurice and I have to
go on to the Poynter’s musical-party; I was depending on
you to take Ivy home or at least to find her a taxi.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I’ll stay for that with pleasure,” Eric answered.</p>

<p class='c009'>The drowsy mutter of slip-shod conversation accelerated
and became excitedly clear as the conductor climbed to his
place. Eric drew his glasses lazily from their case and
swept the boxes on either side of him. George and Barbara
must be almost at right-angles; she could see him, if
he sat forward; she might be looking at him then, but he
dared not focus the glasses on her. Some one in the stalls
underneath him drawled: “Hullo! D’you see Babs and
George? I wonder when they got back?” Then the lights
were lowered, one after another.</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric tried to lose himself in the music. When that failed,
he analyzed the orchestration and concentrated his attention
on the conducting. Barbara’s presence made itself felt, and
he knew that, for all preoccupation, he was waiting until
the stage was dark enough for him to lean forward and steal
a glance at her between Lady Maitland’s square grey head
and Ivy’s dancing black curls. When he turned slowly and
looked at her with all the artificial calm that he could put
forth, she was sitting with one arm on the sill of the box,
fingering a big fan and watching the stage with rapt enjoyment.
He leaned back and closed his eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the end of the act Sir Maurice and Lady Maitland
hurried away, and he moved into the empty chair at the front
<span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'></span>of the box. Barbara was evidently holding a court; her back
was turned to the house, and he could see a phalanx of men
breaking rank, shaking hands, exchanging a word and
squeezing their way out again. George was supporting her
adequately, easily, as though it were natural and as though
he were her husband as of right, never seeing that he was a
grotesque usurper....</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you going to smoke?,” Ivy asked him, as he laid the
glasses down.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t think so,—unless you’d like to.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I prefer just to watch the people. I love the opera! I
love the music and the acting, I love the house and the people
and the dresses and the jewellery. I’ve been here every
night since the beginning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric forced himself to take an interest in her though her
enthusiasm jarred on him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re living with Lady Maitland, aren’t you?,” he
asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes. She wanted a sort of secretary to arrange her
parties and answer her letters and deal with the telephone...
I’m quite enjoying it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I knew you would.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you suggest it to her?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I had a hand in it. I was so shocked—I don’t
mean morally, but you seemed so utterly forlorn and miserable
that night when I came to see you... Are you happy
now?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She looked away without answering for some moments:</p>

<p class='c009'>“If I thought about it, I should be very unhappy. So I
try not to think about it. I try to enjoy myself and keep so
busy... I miss the freedom. It’s great fun being with
Aunt Connie; she’s giving me an awfully good time, and
I’ve all the money and clothes I need; and I’m meeting the
most wonderfully interesting people—<em>You</em> know what her
parties are like.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span>“Then what earthly excuse have you for being unhappy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It isn’t everything,” she sighed.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no taxi to be found in the neighbourhood of
Covent Garden, and after a fruitless walk down the Strand
they struck across the Park. At the corner of Buckingham
Palace an officer in an open car, with a girl beside him,
leaning on his shoulder, passed them and turned with a jerk
of the head to look a second time and to wave his hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Was that intended for me, do you suppose?” Eric
asked. “My eyes aren’t good enough—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was Johnnie Gaymer,” she answered.</p>

<p class='c009'>Though her voice was dispassionate enough, Eric fancied
that he had felt her hand dragging against his arm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I haven’t seen him for a long time,” he murmured.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nor have I... He lives in Buckingham Gate...
Rather a nice flat,” she explained jerkily.</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric was vaguely disquieted at seeing Gaymer, as though
not to see him were to bring his existence to an end. The
moment’s glimpse had disturbed Ivy as much as his own
meeting with Barbara. She spoke hurriedly, with unconcern
too elaborate to be convincing; unconsciously she quickened
her pace. And Eric would have wagered a year’s income
that Ivy’s unhappiness was linked with Gaymer’s treatment
of her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wonder whether we shall get a taxi at Victoria,” she
murmured as though she knew and wanted to interrupt his
thoughts.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I certainly don’t want to walk home from Eaton Place.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was distasteful to suspect a man, when there was no
basis for suspicion, but Eric felt that Gaymer was not to be
trusted. That conceded, it was plausible to imagine that Ivy
had fallen in love with him and that he had tried to exploit
her devotion for his own amusement. Either he had misjudged
the character of his quarry or else he was waiting for
her to come to her senses. Eric remembered his glimpse of
<span class='pageno' title='93' id='Page_93'></span>the girl in the car, lolling back with her head on Gaymer’s
shoulder: it was a reasonable guess that Ivy had drifted
without seeing where he was leading her and had pulled
herself up in time to administer an unexpected rebuff....</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric was startled out of his reverie when she drew her arm
out of his and waved to a taxi.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t come any farther with me!,” she begged. “It was
simply sweet of you to toil right out of your way like this.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I’ll drop you in Eaton Place and take the taxi on.”
It was the most obvious and comfortable arrangement for
both. As she hesitated to accept it, Eric became suddenly
suspicious that she wanted to get rid of him and to be
alone. The sight of Gaymer with another woman had hurt
her until she had to cry—and to cry where no one would see
her. As she stood with set face and eyes averted, against
the immense gloomy background of the palace, with the wind
blowing through her hair and snatching at her cloak, she
seemed even more fragile and forlorn than on the night when
she had begged him to come home with her from the
theatre.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Won’t you let me stay with you for another two minutes?,”
he begged her gently. “I promised Lady Maitland to
see you home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She only asked you to find me a taxi.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you’re condemning me to walk the whole way from
here to Ryder Street!” he protested.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Won’t you find a taxi at Victoria? Or you can have this
one, and I’ll walk; I’m nearly home now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>To press his company on her any further would have been
persecution.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You have your latch-key?,” he asked. “And d’you want
any money?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve plenty, thanks. Good-night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He slammed the door to and turned back towards the
Park. As he paused to light a cigarette, the noise of the
<span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span>taxi grew fainter and died almost away; then it seemed to
become unaccountably clearer, and he looked up with surprise.
The taxi was returning, and, though he could not see
any one inside, the flag was down, and he recognized the
driver. In another moment it had passed him and swept
away to the right down Buckingham Gate. Eric started in
pursuit. If his suspicions were anything but the fruit of a
disordered imagination, Ivy Maitland was preparing to fight
the unknown woman for possession of Gaymer.</p>

<p class='c009'>His pace slackened, as he tried to think how he should
explain or justify himself to Gaymer. He came to a standstill,
as he remembered that he did not know Gaymer’s
address.</p>

<p class='c026'>“Novelty is to love like bloom to fruit; it gives a lustre, which
is easily effaced, but never returns.”</p>

<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Half-past</span> twelve was striking, as Eric entered his flat.
A pile of letters awaited him, but he went into his bedroom
without looking at them and began to undress. His unexpected
walk had tired him, and he wanted to go to sleep
before his brain woke up to puzzle itself over Ivy Maitland
or to reconstruct his meeting with Barbara and imagine ways
in which he could have carried it off with greater dignity or
triumph. Until twenty minutes ago he fancied that he
understood the few elements of Ivy’s simple character; but,
if she were forcing her way into Gaymer’s flat to evict
another woman, she had more passion and determination than
her record of short-lived impulses warranted his expecting....</p>

<p class='c009'>The telephone-bell by his bed mercilessly violated the silence
of the room; and he spun around to face it, dropping
his watch. No one but Barbara had ever telephoned to him
at such an hour; at such an hour she had hardly missed one
night in fifteen months, when they were both in London;
when last she telephoned to him at such an hour, two and a
half years before, he had returned home after saying good-bye
to her; next day he was leaving for America; and he
had let the bell ring on unanswered, muffling it with his
handkerchief, when he could bear the noise no longer and
trying to face his new conception of Barbara as a woman for
<span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span>whom honour and love had no meaning. For two and a half
years he had wondered what would have happened if he had
listened to her pleading... He took a step towards the bed
and then retraced it.</p>

<p class='c009'>As he picked up his watch and continued to wind it, the
bell rang again. This time he advanced to the telephone
unhesitatingly, but with the dread of a man compelled to
draw back the sheet from a corpse’s face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hullo?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is that Mr. Lane? It’s Lady Maitland speaking. I
hope you weren’t asleep?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He sat heavily on the bed, limp for the moment with relief.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I’m not undressed yet, thanks.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I rang you up to find out what had happened to Ivy.
She’s not come in yet; and she’s such a little harum-scarum...
Did you bring her home?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric wanted to think over the answer and knew that he
had no time.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I put her into a taxi,” he said promptly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh... Then she <em>ought</em> to be home by now... She
didn’t say she was going on to a party, did she?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No... I hope there’s nothing wrong, Lady Maitland.
If <em>I</em> can do anything... Search-parties or anything of that
kind?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh <em>no</em>! She <em>must</em> be in soon. I thought I’d just find
out... Good-night!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric lighted a cigarette and threw himself, half-undressed,
on the bed. He could have done no good by handing on insubstantial
suspicions... Half-an-hour later he went to
bed with an unresolved riddle on his mind and found himself,
in his dreams, counselling Ivy or tracking Gaymer. The
riddle kept him company at breakfast, and, as he came to the
end of his letters, he was wondering whether to call for an
explanation, when Ivy herself was announced.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='97' id='Page_97'></span>She shook hands and looked round the room with a show
of interest, as his secretary collected her papers and withdrew.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope I’m not disturbing you?,” she asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think I was expecting you. Won’t you sit down?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She arranged herself with her back to the light, a moment
too late to keep Eric from seeing that her face was colourless
but for blue-grey shadows under her eyes; a black hat and
black dress with transparent sleeves from shoulder to wrist
accentuated her pallor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I won’t keep you a minute; it’s about last night,” she
began breathlessly. “You must have thought it very funny
of me to ask you not to see me home, making you walk home
yourself—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was fair to assume that you weren’t going straight
home,” Eric laughed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ivy’s strangulated voice and expression of tragedy
warned him not to laugh again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—went out to supper,” she explained. “Aunt Connie
told me she rang you up to know what had happened to me.
So, if she says anything about it—”</p>

<p class='c009'>She stopped in embarrassment at Eric’s look of surprise.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suspect you of trying to involve me in a conspiracy,
Miss Maitland,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Conspiracy?... Aunt Connie said that you were
anxious and that you’d kindly offered to send out search-parties
or something—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So you came in person to set my mind at rest instead of
writing or telephoning! Your aunt was very anxious, I
thought.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m afraid she was. You see, I hadn’t told her beforehand.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ivy tried to look him frankly in the face, then lowered her
eyes and pretended to inspect the furniture and pictures.
Eric turned away and lighted a cigarette.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='98' id='Page_98'></span>“Did you know anything about it, yourself, beforehand?”
He gave her time to decide whether it was worth while to
speak the truth. “I don’t say I <em>will</em> be your accomplice,
but, if you want me to be, you must tell me everything.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My accomplice in what?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric turned with a smile and offered her a cigarette:</p>

<p class='c009'>“To put it quite brutally, in concealing from your aunt
what happened last night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And what did happen?,” she demanded.</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric found her effort to put him out of countenance by
attempted haughtiness of tone pathetically unsuccessful.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You went to Gaymer’s flat in Buckingham Gate. I don’t
say there <em>wasn’t</em> any supper; I don’t even say there wasn’t
a party, if three constitute a party. It was informal, however,
and as much of a surprise to the host as to his guests.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ivy jumped up indignantly and subsided slowly in defeat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know what you mean!,” she cried with a last
rally.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Am I right so far?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How did you find out?,” she asked limply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Intuition, if you like. You went there on the spur of
the moment, because you’d seen him driving home with
another woman. You went there to make a scene with the
other woman.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I wanted to talk to him about something.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Doesn’t it come to the same thing?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I never even saw her. I don’t know who she was.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a long pause. Eric changed his chair so that
he should not seem to be watching her face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, so far my intuition has been fairly good,” he said.
“Isn’t it your turn now?” There was no answer. “I’m
hardly adding anything, if I say that you’re in love with
Gaymer and jealous of the other woman.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’d no right to be there!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='99' id='Page_99'></span>“Oh, come! I’m afraid neither Gaymer nor any other
man would allow you to dictate who may go to his flat.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But he’s engaged to <em>me</em>!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Her left hand was bare and carried no ring; Eric seemed
to remember her telling him overnight that she had not seen
Gaymer for some time; and, when he went into her rooms
off the Adelphi, she had confessed to at least a disagreement.
The engagement seemed unstable.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, <em>that</em> I didn’t know, of course,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was another pause, and the girl turned her head
quickly so that even her profile was hidden from him. Eric
saw the flash of a handkerchief and heard a sob half-choked
down. Throwing away his cigarette, he seated himself on
the arm of the chair and laid his hand on her shoulder.
Nearly three years ago Barbara had swept into that room
like a whirlwind and collapsed as suddenly. Since then he
ought to have learned the price of sympathy....</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wouldn’t it help you to tell me all about it?,” he asked
her gently.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ivy dabbed at her eyes and felt for his hand. Then she
turned and pressed herself against him until he could feel the
fluttering of her heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>That’s</em> why I told you I was desperate,” she gulped, burying
a tear-stained face of misery on his shoulder. “<em>That’s</em>
why I told you at the opera that I couldn’t allow myself to
<em>think</em> of things... We met on the way back from America;
we liked each other, we were always meeting. When life at
home became more than I could stand, he helped me...
But I told you all about that... It was glorious at first,
I’d never been in love, I felt I’d never been happy before.
I used to dine with him almost every night and go on to a
dance. He’s a beautiful dancer, and I adore dancing. I
seemed to <em>belong</em> to him... When we didn’t do that, we
used to go to a theatre, or he’d just come and talk to me in
my rooms, or I’d go and talk to him—”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span>“Didn’t you feel that was rather a risk?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Either the girl did not hear him or she deliberately ignored
the interruption.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t think any one <em>could</em> be so happy,” she went on.
“I remember thinking how wrong you were... <em>Some</em> days
weren’t as perfect as others, of course. I suppose I’m very
jealous, but I loved him so much that I simply hated to see
him <em>speak</em> to another woman; <em>I</em> never wanted to speak to
another man, so it wasn’t fair... We’d had a row that
night when I met you after the theatre. A woman—she was
rude to me, deliberately; he said he’d known her for years,
but <em>that</em> didn’t make any difference or give her the right...
I never said anything to her, but I could see she hated me;
and he just laughed at us both and seemed to enjoy it. I
refused to have anything to do with him for ten days after
that. Then he apologized and said the woman had once
been in love with him and he didn’t want a scene in public...
Then we became engaged.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She threw out the words so abruptly that Eric was conscious
of disproportion, even of omission.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What happened?,” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He took me out to dinner, and we went on to a dance at
the Burlington Rooms. Then we went to his flat for supper.
I didn’t want to go at first, because it was after two, but he
begged so hard and said he was leaving London next day.
We became engaged then.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric was still conscious of an omission.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was never announced, was it?,” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No. He didn’t want us to marry until he knew whether
he was going to stay on in the army. He wants to be demobilized
as soon as possible; he has friends in the City—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But that’s no reason why the engagement shouldn’t be
announced,” Eric persisted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He didn’t want it. He made me promise to keep it a
secret. I oughtn’t to have told you, but last night—”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='101' id='Page_101'></span>She broke off and began to cry again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, what happened then?” he asked her after a pause.</p>

<p class='c009'>“After that—My work in his department was over; and,
when Aunt Connie asked me to come and stay with her, I
went. Johnnie didn’t like my going, he said he’d never see
anything of me—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I thought he was going away himself?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, he didn’t go—after all. At least, not then. I saw
him whenever we could arrange it, he used to come and
dine... He complained that he never had me to himself;
but I told him that, as soon as the engagement was announced,
he could have me as much to himself as he liked.
When my sisters were engaged, every one ran away as if
they’d got plague... I <em>did</em> dine with him once or twice,
but in some ways Aunt Connie’s as bad as mother; she always
comes into my room at night to see I’m home and
she’d have had a fit, if she’d known that I was dining alone
with Johnnie. We used to invent people—‘Captain Richards’
and ‘Mrs. Bosanquet’; whenever Aunt Connie wanted
to know who’d been there, I used to say ‘Captain Richards
and Mrs. Bosanquet’.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She laughed feebly at her strategem, but Eric was disquieted.
Innocence or stupidity might excuse her for running
risks; but there must be a blind spot in her conscience,
if she could tell a lie so light-heartedly and then talk about it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And what happened then?,” he asked, deferring censure
for fear of drying the stream of her confidence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, then the opera started, and I hardly saw him at all.
Aunt Connie was there every night, and I felt she <em>had</em> first
call on me. Besides, I liked going; and there was always
room in the box, if he’d wanted to come. He said he didn’t
care to be with me when there was a crowd of other
people... Then he <em>did</em> go away. That was weeks ago, and
I didn’t see him again till last night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did he write?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span>Ivy turned with anguished protest in her eyes, as though
he had asked the question for the pleasure of hurting her:</p>

<p class='c009'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And what happened last night?”</p>

<p class='c009'>As she hesitated, he could see her hardening; and the
grip on his hand tightened.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hardly knew what I was doing,” she whispered. “I
couldn’t see... But I felt I <em>had</em> to go... He opened the
door, and I asked him... Her coat was on a chair. I
shan’t tell you what we said... But I <em>did</em> tell him he was
a beast to behave like that, when he was engaged to me, a
beast not to write, a beast to make me miserable!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Her voice had risen, she had drooped away from him and
was crying without concealment. Eric lifted her hand to his
lips and put an arm around her shoulders, drawing her to
him until her cheek lay against his breast.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You must steady yourself, Ivy! I warn you that, when
any one cries, I’m always liable to join in!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You? I don’t mind what you do! You’ve been ripping
to me—right from the first time we met... I <em>hate</em> men!
I’d never tell <em>any</em> man what I’ve told you. I don’t know
why you let me; you’ve better things to do, I should have
thought.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, perhaps I hope that I may be useful. What happened
then?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ivy dabbed jerkily at her eyes and tried to steady her
voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He said that, if I thought so badly of him, we’d better
end the engagement,” she went on.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There I agree with him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I said I only asked him to behave <em>properly</em> to me. He
said the whole thing was a mistake and, if I wouldn’t end
it, he would. I said I wouldn’t let him!”</p>

<p class='c009'>She wiped her eyes and began smoothing the front of her
dress as though she had nothing to add. Eric got off the
<span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span>arm of her chair and stood facing her with his shoulders
against the mantelpiece.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t think me prejudiced,” he began, “if I admit that I
don’t greatly care for Gaymer, but believe me when I tell
you that you’re very well out of it—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I’m <em>not</em>!,” she interrupted. “I won’t <em>let</em> him break
it off!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I imagine you’re not prepared to share him,” Eric suggested
drily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I love him more than any one in the world!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s not enough by itself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She fingered her handkerchief for a moment and then
broke out explosively:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I <em>won’t</em> let him go!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How can you keep him?” Eric asked. “Will you
threaten him with an action for breach of promise?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll do anything!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He shook his head and waited for her to calm herself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In the first place you couldn’t prove that there’d ever
been a promise to marry,” he began. “In the next place, as
it’s never been announced, you couldn’t prove damage.
He’s not kept you from marrying any one else; and a jury
wouldn’t give a farthing for your heart or feelings. And
it’s fantastic to think that you can <em>make</em> a man marry you
by threatening an action if he doesn’t. What kind of married
life do you look forward to after that? Of course, I
don’t know whether he was serious last night or whether
you’d both lost your tempers; but, if he meant it, you must
regard the thing as being over.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Pouting and rebellious, Ivy stared at her shoes and bit at
the border of a crumpled handkerchief:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I won’t!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear, you must! However much you love him, he’s
not worth having unless he loves you. What can you do to
make him?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span>“I’ll publish the engagement!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And if he contradicts it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He wouldn’t! He couldn’t! He couldn’t be such a
brute!” She was startled by her own vehemence and repeated
in a whisper more poignant than the cry: “Oh, he
couldn’t!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric looked at her and walked away to the window. Pillowing
his chin on his arms, he stared into the lifeless street
below. Somewhere in the silent flat a clock struck twelve;
a second and a third joined in with softly discordant chimes,
and he realized that he had been sprawling there in mental
catalepsy for ten minutes....</p>

<p class='c009'>“From your account—you’ve told me everything, I take
it—?” he asked uncertainly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Everything!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He shrugged his shoulders and turned back to the room,
avoiding her eyes because he knew that she was lying.
There was no proof, but her desperate intensity convinced
him, and he wondered why he had not guessed before.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What are you going to do?,” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know. I didn’t mean to talk to you about this.
I only wanted you not to give me away to Aunt Connie.”
She stood up and looked round the room for a mirror. “Do
I look very awful? I cried myself sick last night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come into the next room and tidy up,” he suggested.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I could drown myself!,” she cried.</p>

<p class='c009'>He gave her a clean handkerchief and watched her thoughtfully
as she bathed and dried her eyes. When she took off
her hat and smoothed her short dark hair, she would have
passed anywhere as a slim boy of fifteen masquerading in a
woman’s black dress. As he watched her, his mind went
back to their first conversation in New York, and he felt
that he had foreseen everything as well as if she carried her
future branded on her forehead. It was a tragedy from
which he could see no escape, perfect material for the third
<span class='pageno' title='105' id='Page_105'></span>act of a play; and the psychology and emotion had been
presented to him without any strain on his imagination...
But artistic detachment was an indecency when a mere child
was being ruined and heartbroken for the passing pleasure of
a man like Gaymer. She was spiritually ruined whether
Gaymer married her or not....</p>

<p class='c009'>“You mustn’t talk like that,” he said gently. “I’m going
to think whether I can suggest anything. May I take you
home? A walk will do me good.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They left Ryder Street and crossed the Park without exchanging
six words. Here and there the passers-by paused
and looked back to marvel at their preoccupation, for both
walked with knitted brows and bent heads, Ivy to hide her
red eyes, and Eric to concentrate his thoughts with no other
distraction than brown gravel and grey flag-stones. They
said good-bye in Eaton Place after arranging to meet at the
opera.</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric turned back towards Grosvenor Place and walked to
the Thespian Club. As he entered the dining-room, a hand
was laid on his arm. Carstairs was lunching with Deganway,
and they greeted him with an air of grievance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ve just cut us <em>once</em>. Don’t make a habit of it,”
said Deganway.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m sorry! May I join you? And tell me where I cut
you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was in the Park,” said Deganway. “We were coming
here from the Foreign Office, and you were walking with a
young and lovely sylph. It was quite deliberate. I think I
shall have to tell John Gaymer about it; on my honour I
shall.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric reached for the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">menu</span></i> and began to write his bill.
Deganway was the most intolerable gossip in London, but
a gossip was sometimes useful.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How does <em>he</em> come into it?,” he asked at length.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, those two! My dear, she’s Johnnie’s latest passion...
<span class='pageno' title='106' id='Page_106'></span>At least I haven’t heard of any one later. You’d
better watch out, if he finds you poaching. You <em>are</em> behindhand.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We can’t compete with you, Gerry,” said Carstairs.</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric made no comment, but he ordered a light luncheon
and ate it as quickly as it could be served. He had offered
to take Ivy home because he knew that he could do no work
while he was thinking of her; and it was useless to go back
to his rooms or to fancy that he could compose his mind
until he had done something for her or satisfied himself that
nothing could be done. He wondered whether she knew
that he had guessed... The slim, black figure with the
short, boyish hair haunted him; he saw her in every corner
of the dining-room and heard her cry of despair above the
clatter of plates and the babble of voices. Once he tried to
tell himself that it was not his business... But she had
talked to him because there was no one else....</p>

<p class='c009'>Before he could do anything, he had to hear Gaymer’s
version. That had been obvious from the first, but he had
seen only the precipitous difficulties of a meeting until a
chance hint from Deganway shewed him how to overcome
them. As soon as he had finished his meal, he telephoned
to find out whether Gaymer was at home. A voice answered
that he was not expected until after six, and Eric strode
into the Park to be by himself and to rehearse the interview.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no one who could undertake it for him. He
passed General Maitland, the judge and Ivy’s two brothers
in rapid review, but they were the last people who must ever
know. Then, waiving preliminaries, he wondered what he
was going to say to Gaymer. Plain speaking was more salutary
than effective. Gaymer might deny everything, he
might laugh; this was probably not the first time that he had
got himself into an ambiguous position, and he had probably
received his share of plain speaking. Moreover, invective
did not help Ivy. Eric tried to make up his mind whether
<span class='pageno' title='107' id='Page_107'></span>he wanted, whether he would help, whether he would even
allow her to marry such a man....</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no one who could advise him. Amy Loring
was a sensible, sympathetic woman, but, where sex morals
were in question, she rather boasted of her old-fashioned intolerance.
To tell her would be to alienate her forever from
some one to whom she was at present mildly attached.
Sonia O’Rane had crammed a life-time of experience into
thirty years and would probably respect a girl the more
flagrantly she overthrew the conventional canons of morality.
But it was never safe to entrust Sonia with a secret. The
longer he thought over it, the more clearly Eric saw that the
secret could be shared with no one.</p>

<p class='c009'>He walked slowly into the Green Park and timed his arrival
at Buckingham Gate for half-past six. Gaymer had
come home a moment before him and was still standing in the
hall with his cap on, opening letters. For an instant he betrayed
surprise at receiving a call from a man whom he
knew but slightly and had never invited to his flat, but the
surprise was banished without an effort.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hullo! How are you?,” he jerked out. “Just let me
finish these, will you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wanted to have a word with you, if you could spare
time,” said Eric.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come along.” Gaymer crossed the hall slowly, reading
the last of his letters, and threw open the door of a small
sitting-room decorated with <cite>Vogue</cite> plates and furnished with
a divan, two arm-chairs and a low Moorish table. “What’ll
you have to drink?,” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing, thanks... I’d better explain <em>why</em> I’m here.
I was at the opera last night, and Lady Maitland asked me to
see Ivy home. I put her into a taxi just by the Royal
Stables, but, when I got home, Lady Maitland telephoned to
say that she wasn’t in yet; did I know what had happened
<span class='pageno' title='108' id='Page_108'></span>to her? This morning Ivy called on me, and I gathered that,
after leaving me, she’d come here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gaymer rang the bell and ordered whiskey to be brought
in.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So it was you she was walking with?” he said. “I
couldn’t see.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes... As the result of coming here, she’s rather upset;
and I wanted to straighten things out, if I could.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gaymer filled his tumbler and looked at Eric over the top,
slightly raising his eyebrows.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, drive ahead,” he recommended.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You and she are engaged, aren’t you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did she tell you that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should like to hear if that is so.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gaymer emptied half the tumbler and set it down behind
him on the mantelpiece.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Would</em> you?,” he asked with a smile. “I rather feel
that’s my business.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not entirely. She’s a friend of mine... You and she
were being discussed at lunch to-day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“At the Thespian. <em>Are</em> you engaged to her?,” Eric persisted.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the short pause which followed both men seemed to resolve
no longer to waste time on appearances and the circumlocution
of civility.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What the devil’s that to you?,” Gaymer demanded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you going to marry her?,” asked Eric.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you want to marry her yourself?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’d sooner marry her myself than see her married to
you,” said Eric and repented of the words almost before
they were spoken. In themselves they were harmless, but
he did not want Gaymer to see that his cool insolence and
jerky monosyllables were wearing down his own patience.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='109' id='Page_109'></span>“Well, <em>I</em> won’t stop you, if you think you’ll have any
success.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s not the point. She says you promised to marry
her, and I want to know if you’re going to keep your
promise.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I see. Well, <em>I</em> want to know just where you think you
come in.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’s a friend of mine,” Eric repeated.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bully for her! But I’m afraid I don’t hold myself responsible
to any friend of hers who chooses to come here
and ask impertinent questions.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Naturally. But I think I may say she’s asked my
advice. Certainly I’ve given her advice, and she seems to be
guided by it to some extent.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bully for her again!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She was talking of making the engagement public.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gaymer was only impressed to the extent of hesitating
for an instant; then he shewed himself more assured than
ever:</p>

<p class='c009'>“And, if your advice to her is worth a damn, you told her
not to do that!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You don’t want to marry her, then?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gaymer first yawned and then frowned with a sudden
irritability that suggested more that he wanted to end the interview
than that he had lost his temper.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whether I want to or not is beside the point!” he exclaimed.
“I’ve no money to marry on. <em>She</em> knows that.
I don’t know from one day to another whether I’m going to
be demobilized. I can’t marry on my pay.” He looked
round with sensual appreciation of the simple warmth and
softness of his quarters. “Far too fond of personal comfort
for that. Have I satisfied your curiosity enough now?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, you haven’t told me why you promised to marry
her,” Eric persisted.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='110' id='Page_110'></span>“<em>Did</em> I promise? I should be enormously interested to
know why you say that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because she told me, and in this instance I believe her
word in preference to yours. <em>Why</em> you promised to marry
her—I needn’t bother you to tell me that. I suppose you
found it a necessary formality.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric waited for a denial, though he knew that it would
tell him nothing. Guilty or innocent, Gaymer must now lose
his temper in vehement earnest.</p>

<p class='c009'>And yet no denial came.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did she tell you that, too?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I chose to infer it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re a desirable friend for a girl to have, if you choose
to infer that sort of thing about her... Lane, the artistic
temperament runs away with you. Now, if you’ll excuse
me, I <em>must</em> go and dress. But, any time you think of anything
else you’d like to ask me, don’t hesitate to drop in.
I’m nearly always at home this time of day and I can give
you a cocktail, if you’ll tell me how to get hold of any gin.
Good-bye.”</p>

    <div>THE REWARD OF SYMPATHY</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>“And... there came down a certain priest that way: and...
he passed by on the other side.</p>

<p class='c023'>“And likewise a Levite...”</p>
<div class='c024'><span class='sc'>S. Luke</span>: 10. 31-2.</div>
<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Eric</span> drove to Ryder Street with the knowledge that he had
been beaten; and for the first time, now that it was too late
to be of any use, he explored his motives in going. An ingrained
conventional sense of fitness told him that, when a
man had behaved as Gaymer had done, he must marry his
victim as a matter of honour; more rational modern teaching
objected that a man would commit two crimes instead
of one if he consented to marry a woman whom he did not
love. Eric felt he must really have assumed that Gaymer
loved Ivy but that he was too inconsiderate to treat her
kindly; he had himself gone to Buckingham Gate to demand
an explanation rather than to force on the marriage.</p>

<p class='c009'>But he had been beaten. And what else could he have
expected, after interfering in something that did not concern
him? Gaymer’s victorious rebuff did not matter so much as
his adroitness in preventing their ever getting to grips over
Ivy; he might marry her, or he might not, but at least he
had made it plain that he would not be coerced even into
saying whether he cared for her....</p>

<p class='c009'>In his bath and as he dressed, Eric became permeated
with the feeling that Gaymer had no intention of marrying.
An honourable man with an unclouded conscience would
have resented interference far more warmly; and a man who
<span class='pageno' title='112' id='Page_112'></span>meant to keep his engagement had no motive for not publishing
it. And, after all, when Ivy had overcome her immediate
unhappiness, was not this all for the best? In a
further analysis Eric fancied that he had gone to assure himself
of Gaymer’s bad faith, in part because he distrusted the
fellow and in part because he did not want to see Ivy’s youth
sacrificed to him. Perhaps he would have been a little disappointed
if Gaymer had explained everything convincingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first act of Aida was over before Eric reached Covent
Garden. Hardly seeing who nodded to him, he hurried
through the crowded hall to the pit-tier, only conscious of
the languid, chattering double procession on the stairs, as of
a well-dressed, rich and soulless stage-army that never participated
in the emotions and crises of life; these people surrounded
and stared uncomprehendingly at the drama in their
midst, but they seemed to have no drama of their own.
George Oakleigh’s box-door was open, but he had passed it
before he had time to wonder who was inside and in
another moment was apologizing to Lady Maitland for his
lateness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>I</em> must apologize to <em>you</em>,” she said, “for disturbing you
last night. It was this naughty child’s fault. She went on
to a party and never warned me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ivy’s excuse had apparently been accepted without further
question, and Eric bowed and shook hands with her as
though they had not met earlier that day. She was paler
than in the morning, and her eyes and cheeks were hollow
with fatigue. He could have described every thought that
was passing like a white-hot needle through her brain, for
she was feeling as he had felt when Barbara broke faith with
him, betrayed and utterly lost; ultimately it might be all for
the best, but days of agony lay ahead of her, and she would
learn how long and pitiless the nights could be.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the lights were lowered, he pulled his chair forward,
resting his arms on the sill of the box. Ivy leaned back to
<span class='pageno' title='113' id='Page_113'></span>screen herself from her aunt, and, when he put down his
glasses and half-turned to offer them to her, he saw tears
standing in her eyes. Feeling for her hand, he pressed it
gently, and a tear splashed hot and startling on to his own.
She gripped and held his fingers till the end of the act; and,
as the curtain fell, he stood up and made a barrier of himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think this is the appropriate moment for tobacco and
fresh air,” he suggested. “You not coming, Lady Maitland?
Will you, Miss Maitland?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He opened the door without waiting for a reply and hurried
her downstairs and into the street before the first call
had been taken.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s cooler here,” he began, as they walked towards Long
Acre. “Do you mind about smoking in public?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I feel too ill, thanks... Mr. Lane, I can’t bear it!
All this afternoon I had to hold myself back to keep from
rushing around and beating on his door! I couldn’t stay in
the same room as a telephone. I <em>had</em> to see him and I was
afraid he’d turn me away... I can’t bear it, I <em>can’t</em>!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ssh! I’ve been through this, Ivy, longer and worse than
I pray you’ll ever know. And you can only get over it by
setting your teeth—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t <em>want</em> to get over it!,” she broke out.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you must. And you must begin getting over it to-night.
Ivy, I went to see Gaymer this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She turned on him in swift surprise which changed to
dawning hope. But there was nothing in his face to encourage
hope, and her eyes dulled to resignation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes?,” she whispered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You may say, if you like, that I had no business to interfere.
I went to see if I could do any good. I did no
good at all, I found out nothing and I came away with what’s
commonly called a flea in my ear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Was she—?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='114' id='Page_114'></span>Ivy could not bring herself to finish the sentence, but Eric
guessed its end and shook his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t think she has anything to do with it. I don’t
believe he ever meant to marry you from the moment when
he refused to publish the engagement.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But he promised, he gave me his oath!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because he... saw you expected it of him. Ivy, you
said this morning that you’d told me everything...” She
covered her face with both hands as though he had struck her.
“Dear child, I’m not asking for the pleasure of torturing
you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>She hurried on without answering by word or nod, and
Eric had his answer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You poor child!,” he whispered. “Ivy, I promised to
help you, if I could; you know that this makes no difference,
don’t you? Except that I’m a thousand times more anxious
to help you. I’ll help you in any way I can. But you must
help me to help you; you have to put all your courage into
this—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I <em>can’t</em>! I want to <em>die</em>!,” she sobbed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t talk like that! This is a frightful thing for you,
but you must see it in perspective. When once you’ve the
pluck to recognize it’s all over... You’ve told no one
else; no one else has guessed, no one else will ever know—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But they can’t <em>help</em> it!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ivy—”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric looked at her, and the glib solace died on his lips.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ivy, pull yourself together and listen to me!” he whispered.
“You’re not to tell a soul till I give you leave! Do
you promise? I want time to think this out. And it’s
<em>going</em> to be thought out, we’re going to win on this. I swear
to you that I’ll see you through this somehow. Do you
believe me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>His vehemence steadied her, and she nodded quickly:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='115' id='Page_115'></span>“Dry your eyes! We must be getting back, or your aunt
will wonder what’s been happening to us. Are you doing
anything to-morrow? Right! I’ll make a plan for to-morrow,
and we’ll talk things over. Now get control of
yourself and of your voice: talk to me about the opera,
anything. We have to put up a big bluff. Are you ready?”</p>

<p class='c009'>They walked back to the opera-house, lazily discussing the
singers. The hall was still half-full, and they stopped to
exchange a greeting with Dr. Gaisford. In the passage
behind the boxes, Lord John Carstairs and his wife were
pacing slowly up and down, and they stopped again. Deganway
scurried past like a frightened rabbit and confided to
Lady Poynter that Eric Lane and the little Maitland girl
were going about again together.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear, it’s the second time I’ve caught them to-day!,”
he added. “They’re positively inseparable.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric walked on, deep in conversation. Barbara Oakleigh
was standing in the open door-way of her box. He did not
see her, but she looked curiously at his companion and
turned for a second look, as they passed. When they were
out of sight, she returned to the front of her box and
levelled her glasses on them for a moment as they sat down.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s hotter than ever!,” Eric exclaimed. “Lady Maitland,
will you trust Ivy to me for the whole of to-morrow? I
want to take her to Maidenhead, we’d lunch at Skindle’s,
punt gently for about ten yards—which is the limit of my
punting capacity—, tie up under a tree until dinner, dine at
Skindle’s and return to London. May I do that? I promise
not to drown her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lady Maitland smiled guardedly. She had noticed for
some weeks that Eric was interested in her niece, but this
was the first time that he had avowed it; and, though she
was lazily content to keep Ivy at Eaton Place or in Shropshire
until she or her parents came to their senses, a marriage
<span class='pageno' title='116' id='Page_116'></span>so suitable in every way was undeniably the most satisfactory
escape from an awkward family entanglement.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do <em>you</em> say about it, Ivy?,” she asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should love it. It’s sweet of you, Mr. Lane.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll call with a taxi at half-past ten,” said Eric.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the end of the opera he intercepted Gaisford and begged
him to wait and come home for a drink as soon as the
Maitlands had been packed into their car. The distraction
of the stage and of the music, the presence of Ivy and the
touch of her hand, which sought his as soon as the curtain
went up, kept him from thinking clearly; and he needed
the shrewd brain and blunt speech of one who had been a
second father to him in order to correct his own impulses.</p>

<p class='c009'>From Covent Garden to Ryder Street the two men drove
in silence. Only when the doctor had been given an arm-chair,
a brandy and soda and a cigar did he say:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, my son, who’s worrying you now? It’s a mistake
to let people worry you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How d’you know any one’s worrying me?,” asked Eric.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because you’re one of these damned reserved people
who never squeal when they’re hurt themselves, but simply
go through the world inviting other people to hurt them.
Drive ahead. To-morrow’s Sunday, so I don’t mind if you
keep me up late.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric threw himself into one chair and put his feet up in
another.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s in strict confidence, of course,” he began slowly.
“A girl I know slightly has been victimized by some one
whom for brevity I may describe as an “officer and a gentleman”;
now she has to face the consequences. My interest
in the thing’s confined to keeping her from chucking herself
under the nearest train. What’s to be done, Gaisford?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor hoisted himself on to a smaller chair, where he
took up a favourite attitude with feet round the legs and his
arms folded over the back.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='117' id='Page_117'></span>“I want a lot more data than that,” he grunted. “Is she the
girl who was with you to-night?” Eric stared at his cigar
without answering. “Good! I don’t want to know her
name—or the man’s. I take it she’s a girl in a good social
position. And I take it that you’re not proposing that I
should run my head against the law? Good again! Why
doesn’t he marry her?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Doesn’t want to. Never meant to.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Does he know the state she’s in?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t say. With respect, I don’t think it matters. I’d
never encourage any girl to marry a man against his will
just to preserve her reputation.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m inclined to agree. Has she any money?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Her parents have.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She <em>has</em> parents? Then where do you come in?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric laughed with impatient bitterness, jumping up with
a wriggle of his shoulder-blades and beginning to fidget with
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bibelots</span> on his mantelpiece.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s what I’ve been asking myself for some time,” he
jerked out; “and especially while I was bearding the man
this afternoon... Father, mother, married sisters, brothers...
But I don’t think she can go to her people. She
doesn’t get on very well with them at the best of times and,
if I diagnose her aright, she’d screw up her courage to
commit suicide long before she’d screw up her courage to
face them. I met her for a moment in New York, and she’s
confided in me for some reason. She’s one of these modern,
emancipated girls who want to live by themselves and lead
their own lives—”</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor interrupted him with an impatient sniff:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then she needn’t bother to find a father for her child.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear Gaisford, you know the worth and weight of
all that froth! Modern woman wants to make the best of
both sexes; she thinks she can get ‘freedom’ and ‘equality’
without fighting or paying for it. Once present the bill—!
<span class='pageno' title='118' id='Page_118'></span>As I see it, I’m the only soul that the girl can turn to; and,
in that belief, I’ve promised to see her through. I suppose
this sort of thing is happening daily; I suppose she can be
sent somewhere till the trouble’s over... If necessary—I’ve
not thought it out yet—, I’ll take her abroad as my secretary—”</p>

<p class='c009'>A scornful snort interrupted his flow of facile suggestion:</p>

<p class='c009'>“How old is she? Twenty? And a very pretty girl, so
far as I could see. And you’re disgustingly well-known.
Don’t you think it would cause some little comment, if you
and she went on your travels together?... After all, I
think you’d better tell me who she is.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric shook his head, and a silence followed. Then he
shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Connie Maitland’s niece, a daughter of the judge,” he said
at length.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear friend, there are limits to human faith even in
your moral reputation!” cried the doctor. “No, something
can be done in this country, but you must find an excuse for
getting her away from her friends for a considerable time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was wondering whether I’d get my mother to ask her
down to Lashmar.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It wouldn’t be fair on Lady Lane; she’s of the old school.
Besides, your sister wouldn’t give her a fair chance: a
woman’s severest judges are her own sex. And you’ve
brothers; the girl wouldn’t face them. And you always tell
me it’s a dead-and-alive little hamlet where the servants
would gossip and every one would gape and whisper. In
twenty-four hours the responsibility would be laid at <em>your</em>
door, and people would wonder why you didn’t marry her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m beginning to wonder that myself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gaisford prepared to speak and then closed his lips, waiting
for more to come, as Eric covered his eyes with his hand
and tapped the fender with one restless heel. By shutting
out the light he could forget the doctor’s presence and
<span class='pageno' title='119' id='Page_119'></span>imagine the room as he had seen it that morning, with a slim
black figure shrinking into one corner of a big chair. At
this moment—he listened to the calm deliberate ticking of the
clock behind his head—at this moment she was probably lying
on her bed, powerless even to undress, smothering her sobs
in a pillow; or perhaps she was on her knees, praying wildly,
desperately until she fell asleep from exhaustion; when she
awoke, a sense of disaster would cloud and terrify her mind
until it defined itself and she wept to find herself still alive.
The anguished incoherence of her prayers seemed to rise and
swell like wind in the rigging of a ship; he could see her
very clearly, hear her very plainly....</p>

<p class='c009'>The creak of the doctor’s chair recalled him to the present,
and Eric looked cautiously round the room as though uncertain
who was there. From the moment when Ivy came and
sobbed in his arms, he had forgotten everything but an
urgent need to help her; one accusing pile of letters lay
unopened on his writing-table, another was waiting unsigned;
he had done no work; and for the first time in nearly three
years he had hardly thought of Barbara.</p>

<p class='c009'>But there was something more than an abstract desire to
help. He could now confess to himself that he would have
been disappointed if Gaymer had been anxious or even
willing to marry Ivy....</p>

<p class='c009'>“It would be one way out of the difficulty,” he suggested
indifferently.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And it would be one way into a great many others,” said
Gaisford sharply, a little startled to find himself taken so
literally.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You mean I’m damaged goods? I know that,” said Eric
quietly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gaisford made a noise of impatience as he looked up at
the spare frame and thin, vital face in front of him. He
was reasonably proud of the man whom he had so long
kept alive and now restored to full health.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='120' id='Page_120'></span>“I mean nothing of the kind. Eric, you owl, you’re
making a very big income, you’ve a very big reputation all
over the world. You’ve <em>everything</em> to offer. If you’re treating
the question as a profit-and-loss account, I confess I don’t
see what <em>this</em> girl—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t you?” As he stared up at the light, Eric’s eyes
grew bigger and changed from smouldering brown to a black
brilliance that illumined his whole face. “She gives me
youth, beauty... Gaisford, if you try to be cynical, I shall
brain you; she gives me something to talk to, something to
look after, something to care for... Some one who believes
in me... I don’t ask more than that of any woman in these
latter days. All this business about money and position...
God! If I could give everything I’ve got, everything I’m
likely to get, lay it at her feet, persuade her to accept it—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you in love with her?,” the doctor enquired with a
sedative detachment that stilled the passion in Eric’s voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It might make me... I’ve been paralysed for the last
two years; there’s been absolutely nothing in life for me.
I must be fond of that child, or I couldn’t worry about her
so much... If I had somebody to care for, somebody to
try and make happy, somebody to take me out of myself and
make me forget myself... Then I could <em>win</em>... I never
<em>used</em> to be lonely... I’m talking to you as the ideas come,
Gaisford... You said it as a joke, but, if you ask me
seriously why I don’t marry her....”</p>

<p class='c009'>His tone and attitude did not invite cynicism. Gaisford
stood up and laid a hand on his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sit down,” he suggested. “You mustn’t do anything till
you’ve thought this over <em>coolly</em>. In the first place, what do
you know of the girl? She’s broken down completely in
what most men consider to be woman’s first essential.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’s a child,” cried Eric, wrestling free from the numbing
bondage of Gaisford’s sedative voice. “If you told me
that he’d made her <em>drunk</em>... or <em>doped</em> her... I shouldn’t
<span class='pageno' title='121' id='Page_121'></span>be surprised. This is a thing that touched her body and not
her spirit.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor grimaced unconsciously at the romantic
phrasing:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I see. She’s a child, and you think you’re going to form
her mind and character... Don’t interrupt, Eric; every
man thinks that of every woman mentally less mature than
himself. Is she going to be an intelligent companion or a
pathetic doll? Is she honest? Is she honourable? Is she
unselfish? Is she loyal? Has she grit—under the pink and
white of the child? Those are qualities that every wife must
have. In other words,” he continued with prosaic mockery,
“d’you know a—single—dam’—<em>thing</em> about her? Is she
clever enough, Eric, to know how to live with you? I don’t
doubt your patience, affection, self-effacement and the rest,
but you’re a queer customer, you know; an idealist...
you’d hit me if I said she deserved all she’d got...; too
many nerves, much too sensitive; if I tell you you’ve a smut
on your nose, you’ll probably forswear human society and
run away for ten years to a desert island. Can she live with
you without getting on your nerves? And—remember I’ve
seen her for three seconds, at a distance—are you man
enough to control her? I don’t gather she’s learnt much
self-discipline; can you lick her into shape, or will you go
flabby every time she cries?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He waited for an answer, but Eric only murmured:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go on.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Marriage is a long and intimate business. You’re not
marrying her for passion—or money—or social advantage;
you’ve to start right away with what most people come to
when passion’s worn out; you’ve to be <em>companions</em> from the
beginning. And you know as little of her as I do. You
must wait, therefore—”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric interrupted him with a quick gesture:</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='122' id='Page_122'></span>“If I’m to be of any use, I must act at once. The girl’s
nearly out of her mind.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m sorry for her. That doesn’t justify you in doing
something that may send both of you nearly out of your
minds before you’ve been married six months. After all,
something <em>can</em> be done to avoid a scandal. And you must
study her... And study yourself. I mean, have you considered
how you’ll like to have another man’s child always
with you and to pretend it’s yours? Are you strong enough
never to patronize? And do you want a wife who marries
you out of gratitude or one who marries you because she
loves you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I want to have some one in my life who belongs to me,”
Eric answered. “Another man’s child... Complications
generally... I feel rather like a man who tries to escape
from the pains of life by embracing a new faith; the more
services and observances and penances you give me, the
better I shall be pleased.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gaisford wrinkled his nose and sniffed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Excellent for the first week,” he said. “Will you be of
the same mind a year from now, if you find she gets on your
nerves so that you can’t work? This is self-indulgence...
Don’t glare at me! You’re as bad as all the rest, you’ve the
faults of your ridiculous, neurotic generation. This is a
<em>stunt</em>! You’re having enormous fun with a brand-new
emotion... By the way, you’ll probably have to tell your
people everything.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric nodded without speaking. Obviously Lady Lane
would have to be told. She was a kind woman, a practical
Christian; she would be shocked and touched; she too would
think in terms of sacrifice and she would admire her son
extravagantly. In her heart, too, she would despise Ivy as
a traitor who had sold her sex; she would find a thousand
honest objections to the marriage, she would conscientiously
make Ivy miserable by hinting them to her; she would
<span class='pageno' title='123' id='Page_123'></span>exhaust every device for getting her practical Christianity
carried out by deputy; and, if she failed to save her son, he
would lose his mother in the very struggle which she was
making on his behalf.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I see that,” said Eric grimly. “Plenty of obstacles, aren’t
there? And all because she sat in this chair this morning and
cried her heart out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gaisford looked at his watch and jumped up with an
exclamation of dismay:</p>

<p class='c009'>“D’you know it’s two o’clock, Eric? I must get to bed.
Understand! I’m not forbidding the banns, but <em>promise</em> me
to think before you do anything irrevocable; you’re too good
to waste on an impulse. Only one thing more. Why was
she crying this morning?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You can hardly expect her to be light-hearted. I should
think the man didn’t mince matters with her last night—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And she was crying—for <em>him</em>. Don’t forget that, my
friend. Unless she’s right-down vicious, he must have
fascinated her pretty completely before she consented to play
the fool like this; she was <em>very</em> much in love with him. For
all I know, she may be very much in love with him still.
You’re adding to your troubles, if you’ve to chain her by the
leg to keep her from going back to him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She won’t have much temptation when the blackguard’s
deserted her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gaisford put on his hat and coat to the accompaniment
of a succession of grunts:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Women don’t—have much temptation—to go on living—with
men who beat them.—They still do it, though—even
when there are no children,—even when they could run
away... You always underrate the strength of sex in a
woman; I’m afraid you always will. It’s because you’re an
idealist....”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric did not go to bed at once. The conversation had
excited his brain too much; and he felt that, if he had to
<span class='pageno' title='124' id='Page_124'></span>meet Ivy in the morning, he must first deal honestly with
every objection raised by Gaisford and overcome it or be
overcome by it. He started virtuously, as he began to undress,
but quickly tired. There was a trace of powder on
his looking-glass; he could not see his familiar wash-hand-stand
without seeing in imagination Ivy’s slim, black figure
bending over it, as she bathed her eyes. And then he knew
that he had only listened to Gaisford in order to have some
idea what difficulties he had to face.</p>

<p class='c009'>Already his brain was half-unconsciously making plans,
as it had not done since last he had in his life some one who
belonged to him, “somebody to work for and take care of.”
As he had lived through the day with scarcely a thought for
Barbara, so now he could think of her without wincing. He
set himself to think of her deliberately, as she used to come
into the library, or sit on the floor in front of the fire, resting
her head against his knee. Her changes of expression were
as familiar as ever; he could conjure up her phrases, her
intonation and laugh; the touch of her hand was still felt in
his, but he could think of her without pain. That was a silent
answer to Gaisford’s questions.</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric could have put it into words, but he only discovered
it when he was alone, when the flat was empty, when he could
shut his eyes without seeing Barbara’s wan ghost....</p>

    <div>A DOUBLE RESCUE</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>“One marries a girl and lives with a woman. I think I know
something about girls, but I am sure I know nothing about women.”</p>
<div class='c024'><span class='sc'>J. A. Spender</span>: “<span class='sc'>The Comments of Bagshot</span>.”</div>
<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>Though</span> the sun shone with warm encouragement as Eric
swerved and rattled through the forbidding Sunday calm of
Eaton Place, he was chilled by anxiety, a broken night and
a sense of his own amazing rashness. Though he was still
uncommitted in act, his mind had made itself up so firmly
that he could not change it without a breach of faith. And
now he expected to meet with one disappointment after
another: Ivy had proved herself frail and not wholly truthful;
he would find her to be heartless or insipid or commonplace;
perhaps she would reveal a disconcerting streak of
vulgarity, he might well have been mistaken in thinking her
even pretty....</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope you hadn’t arranged to do anything else to-day,”
he said, as they drove to Paddington.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was only going to dine with father and mother,” Ivy
answered listlessly. “The usual Sunday supper.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, we can get back in time for that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t mind missing it for once. He’s just come back
from assizes; and they always make him so pompous that
mother and I can do nothing with him for weeks afterwards.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But he’ll be disappointed,” Eric suggested. Already a
blemish! Ivy always seemed so selfish in her attitude towards
her parents that she might become equally inconsiderate
towards her husband. “We’ll telephone from Maidenhead to
<span class='pageno' title='126' id='Page_126'></span>say you’re coming, and you can ask if you may bring me.
I don’t mind cadging an invitation, because you remember
I was invited once before and couldn’t go.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, they’ll be delighted to see you,” Ivy answered without
enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c009'>Was it a blemish that she acquiesced so easily? Would it
have been a blemish if she had resisted? Eric told himself
that he must cut short this microscopic search for faults, but
he was not disposed to let her off a meeting with her parents.
He would really know very little of Ivy until he had seen
her framed in her own house and flanked by the formidable
judge and his passive consort; a chance encounter in New
York and their few stilted meetings in London revealed only
her insincere social mannerisms, while in their two emotional
passages she had shewn him only the tragic mask.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the cab and in the train neither was at ease, for Eric
did not know how or when to begin speaking, and Ivy stared
blankly out of the window with watery eyes, accepting his
arrangement and disposal of her with dull thanks from a
drooping mouth. Would she always be like this? Must her
vitality always be drawn from him? For months, perhaps
for years, she would mourn her lost lover; Eric would have
to bear with irresponsive apathy... He gave her two
papers, which she allowed to rest on her knees, and tried
to forget his discouragement in looking about him.</p>

<p class='c009'>The station was crowded with men in flannels and girls in
gauzy frocks, all oppressively high-spirited and resolved to
enjoy themselves. Every seat was taken before the train
had been five minutes in the station, and, when it started,
Eric found himself squeezed between Ivy and another girl
in a carriage with six aside and four men standing. He
looked from one to another, contrasting the girls’ faces and
bearing. There was an absurd similarity in hats and dresses,
in their very shape and feature and age. All were wearing
grey or white buckskin shoes, grey or white silk stockings
<span class='pageno' title='127' id='Page_127'></span>thin as gossamer; all were wearing spider’s-web hats and
low-cut dresses with transparent sleeves. Their average
age was twenty; they were perfectly happy, perfectly well-pleased
with themselves and in perfect health. Like that
stage-army overnight at the opera, life—as a thing of ecstasy
or racking pain—passed them by. Ivy watched him, as
he watched them, and he could feel her arm trembling
against his.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I telephoned for a cab,” said Eric, as the train slowed
into Maidenhead. “And a table. And a punt.” There
was no answer; and he leaned towards her, lowering his
voice to a whisper: “Ivy, I’ve been looking forward to this
ever since last night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope you won’t be disappointed in me,” she sighed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall only be disappointed if you don’t enjoy yourself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ivy shivered and hid her face from him; but, as the arrangements
for the day unfolded themselves, she could not
help responding to his solicitude. Nothing had been forgotten,
nothing could have been improved. They drove in
comfort through the crowded, narrow streets of Maidenhead,
while others struggled for cabs or resigned themselves to
walking; a table was waiting for them by an open window,
and intuition had warned him that she would want to lunch
off lobster and strawberries. By luck or contrivance they
were served by the most attentive waiter; the most comfortable
chairs were ready for them at the water’s edge, when
they came out to the lawn for coffee; and the sun blazed
down on them from a cloudless sky. In the hotel several
people had spoken or nodded to Eric; Grace Pentyre and
Lady John Carstairs detached themselves from their parties
to cross the lawn and compliment Ivy on her dress; she felt
her self-respect reviving and surrendered to the enveloping
atmosphere of well-being.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You <em>are</em> good to me!,” she exclaimed suddenly, when
<span class='pageno' title='128' id='Page_128'></span>Eric returned to her after ordering the punt to be made
ready.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you happy?,” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m—enjoying myself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! that’s not enough... I don’t believe I’ve been to
Maidenhead since I was an undergraduate.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Too much work? I’ve never had enough in one year to
keep me busy for one day!,” she exclaimed impatiently.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And I’ve always had more in one day than I could do in
a year, ever since I was a small boy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He helped her into the punt and began paddling up stream
in search of a quiet place for mooring. Half-an-hour
passed before he noticed that he was talking only about himself
and his boyhood, his family and his work; then he
stopped self-consciously, and Ivy looked up eagerly, waiting
for him to go on.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I envy you! I’d give anything to be you!,” she exclaimed.
“When I think of <em>my</em> life... and <em>yours</em>....”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric smiled and headed for the bank, where he made fast
to an obtruding willow-root. Then he stepped into the
middle of the punt, rearranged the cushions at Ivy’s back
and sat beside her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Comfortable?,” he asked her. “Ivy... I want you to
think over what I’m going to say, take your time and tell
me what you make of it when you’ve thought it over from
every point of view for, say, a month.” He lighted a
cigarette and looked straight ahead of him. “I want to
know whether you’ll marry me.” She sat up, rigid with
amazement, looking at him with round eyes. He laid a hand
on her shoulder and pressed her gently back. “I’ve saved a
fair amount of money and I’m making a good income; one
hopes it will go on. I would do all I could to make you
happy... Before you decide, you must try to imagine
whether I’m the sort of person that you think you could
live with. I’m not a professional invalid, but I have to lead
<span class='pageno' title='129' id='Page_129'></span>rather a careful life and I suppose I’ve as many angles as
most bachelors....”</p>

<p class='c009'>When she tried to speak, he had stopped her; but he
found it impossible to go on cataloguing himself while she
sat silent with bitten, bloodless lips.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But... I thought you understood!,” Ivy broke in, as
he paused. “I’m not fit... You... or anybody.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric could not trust himself to look at her, but he felt for
her hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m not asking you to—yet awhile,” he said. “But, when
you’ve had time to think it over... Anything that you’ve
told me, I—I’ve forgotten. In your turn, you’ll have to take
me as you find me... I’m a solitary man... I should like
some one to take care of... Will you think this over, Ivy,
very slowly and very carefully? It’s a big risk... If you
say ‘no’—” he hesitated and shrugged his shoulders. The
doubts of the morning had melted like snow beneath a tropic
sun; he had recovered the mood of overnight in which pity
fiercer than desire set before his eyes the picture of Ivy,
praying in wild despair, and filled his ears with the fancied
mutter of her prayers. If she said “no,” he would be
tempted to plead and argue against her decision and his own
better judgement; he hoped that he might not be tempted—“if
you say ‘no’”—he hesitated again and moistened his lips—“I
can make certain arrangements that will spare you the
worst; if you say ‘yes’, I propose that we get married very
quietly and go abroad for a time. What matters now is that
you should feel comfortable in mind; there’s nothing in the
world for you to worry about.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He withdrew his hand and shaded his eyes to look at the
leisurely procession of boats converging at the gate of
Boulter’s Lock. Now that he had laid his proposal before
her, he seemed cold and repellent where he had meant to
make a single, irresistible gesture of magnanimity; it was
only by giving her everything and by spending himself to
<span class='pageno' title='130' id='Page_130'></span>give her more that he could heal the wounds in his own
spirit. Ivy’s world must be the fairy palace of a dream....</p>

<p class='c009'>As the silence lengthened, he wondered whether he wanted
her to say anything yet... The announcement would create
a sensation. Many would be disappointed, a few pleased by
the surface of romance; his mother would look at the slim,
dark, undeveloped child and wonder whether he had been
captivated by her youthful prettiness and whether such inexperience
could possibly make him happy; he wondered
in his turn whether a mother’s uncanny intuition would
discover that he was not marrying for love. Ivy, for that
matter, would not be marrying for love; she would be marrying,
at nineteen, for safety. Even if she had loved him now,
in ten years’ time she would be a different woman, capable
of a different love; if she were assailed later by a passion
to which she could not now pretend, he wondered how far
gratitude would restrain her....</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t understand...” Ivy’s voice was quavering.
“I’ve been praying to die, ever since I knew... Why
<em>should</em> you...?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Her voice rose tremulously, broke and died away. Still
without looking at her, Eric gripped her wrist.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But why not?,” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m nothing to you, and you’re—It isn’t fair on you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m the best judge of that,” he answered with
exultant, fierce excitement that made his voice harsh. “But
you’re not to decide anything for the moment,” he went on
more gently. “Just tell me—are you happy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He felt his hand brushed by her lips. Then she dragged
her wrist from his fingers and bent forward, burying her
head in her lap.</p>

<p class='c009'>They both felt exhausted; and neither knew what to do
next. The pitiless publicity of Boulter’s Lock held them in
artificial restraint; there were numberless prosaic arrangements
to be contrived, but Eric shirked the emotional
<span class='pageno' title='131' id='Page_131'></span>violence of abruptly broaching them. As she regained composure,
Ivy took off her hat and drew herself upright with
her hands clasped round her knees, looking away from him
to the line of punts under the opposite bank. She had pretty
feet and ankles, pretty arms and shoulders, a straight thin
back and slender neck; since their first meeting she had lost
something of her looks by suddenly becoming so thin, but
the sharpness of outline added to her charm of youth and
delicacy. Eric suddenly remembered his chill of misgiving
as he drove to Eaton Place, expecting to be disappointed in
her; a warm wave of compassion blinded him, and he asked
himself how a man of Gaymer’s upbringing and traditions
could bring himself to commit the social sin for which there
was no pardon; if he had waited till Ivy was married, an
intrigue would have been venial; if he had chosen a girl
from a humbler walk of life, no one would have asked more
than that he should behave liberally to her... That was
conventional morality in England....</p>

<p class='c009'>Perhaps the one impossible thing had been made possible
by the war. For five years there had been whispered
rumours of desolating scandals scotched at the last moment.
England was sex-intoxicated; women married light-heartedly
on a few weeks’ acquaintance and married again a few
months later when their husbands had been killed, without
prejudicing their right to acquire three or four lovers in the
interval. And those who remained technically virtuous talked
sex by day and dreamed it at night; there was nothing they
did not know, nothing they would not discuss, and in this
welter of short-lived artificial excitement, when all were
overworked and overstimulated, when vague cosmic hungers
made themselves felt and an opportunity became a duty, it
was not surprising that some had lost their heads.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Ivy looked too fastidious. Her deferential timidity,
under the skin-deep manner of bustle and efficiency which
had irritated him in New York, was no challenge to a man;
<span class='pageno' title='132' id='Page_132'></span>her youth imposed an obligation on any one with the wit to
see her as an emancipated school-girl; a libertine, when he
had pierced the veneer of assurance, would find her insipid;
and, even if Gaymer was insensible to discrimination and
honourable restraint, Eric could not understand her allowing
herself to fall into his hands. Men and women drifted
dizzily without seeing where they were going or how far they
had gone, but Ivy seemed yet enough of a child to stop
herself by sheer ignorant instinct before she began to drift.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Eric!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He turned quickly, for Ivy had never before used his
Christian name.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Eric...” She hesitated, and he saw that her cheeks were
crimson. “Eric, I want to tell you about Johnnie.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear, I’ve forgotten that there is such a person.”</p>

<p class='c009'>After screwing herself up to do her duty, Ivy did not feel
entitled to be relieved of it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps you won’t think as badly of me afterwards,” she
faltered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I <em>don’t</em> think badly of you! I want a new life to
start from to-day. If we get married—you mustn’t <em>dream</em>
of deciding yet—, I want to obliterate everything that happened
before to-day. So far as our joint life is concerned,
we meet now for the first time. Let’s see all we can of each
other. If we become engaged, we’ll announce it, get married
as soon as possible and go straight out to America. I’ve
always an excuse to go there for as long as I like; we can
come back when it suits us and we can settle down to domestic
life in England. It’s very probable that you’ll meet
Gaymer—I’ve found that you can’t avoid meeting people in
London, however much you may want to—, but you’ll meet
him as a mere acquaintance. And, Ivy, the only thing <em>I</em>
know of him is that I’ve run across him for three years in
other people’s houses and have never invited him to my own,
<span class='pageno' title='133' id='Page_133'></span>because we don’t seem to have anything in common. Isn’t
that enough?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She made a vague movement with head and shoulders, but
he could see that she was hardly listening to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—can’t understand,” she faltered. “You must despise
me so, and I’ve nothing to give... It’s like a dream.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m asking you to give me the whole of yourself for all
my life...,” Eric answered. “Now I’m going to paddle
you back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Though there had been no rain for several weeks, a strong
stream was flowing, and he punted swiftly to Skindle’s lawn
before he found that it was still too early for tea. Shooting
under Maidenhead Bridge, he crossed to the Berkshire side
and drifted until he found another stretch of shady bank
under which they could moor the boat and smoke. Ivy beckoned
him to her side and struck a match for his cigarette.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Eric, I shall never be able to <em>do</em> anything for you,” she
whispered. “All you say is that <em>you</em> want to make <em>me</em> happy!
Long before I met you, I’d wanted to meet you, because you
wrote such wonderful plays. In New York... If anybody’d
told me I was going to marry you, I should have burst
out laughing. You were so big and famous. Coming over
on the boat I hardly dared speak to you. I can’t believe it
yet... If I came to you as I was in New York—I <em>had</em>
something to give then—, I couldn’t believe it. But I never
knew you then, I never thought that any man... out of a
book, I mean... Oh, I can <em>never</em> do enough, I can never
<em>begin</em> to repay you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Her urgency sent a glow through blood which Eric once
thought would never again be warm. He wanted to see
his mother and Gaisford, to say to them: “You told me to
make one more effort, and I’ve made it. You told me to
forget myself. Well, I have; and I’ve won. The biggest
effort... and the biggest victory....”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='134' id='Page_134'></span>“Love must be dead long before a man renders a bill, Ivy,”
he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I want to pay without waiting for it!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But love hasn’t been born yet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, it has, Eric!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“When?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“When you promised... You know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric laughed and took her hand:</p>

<p class='c009'>“When you thought you were dreaming? You’re dreaming
still, Ivy. That’s why I won’t let you decide till you’ve
had time to wake up and think. Cold, grey, early-morning
thinking... Perhaps I’m dreaming too. It seems so
long... And you’re so absurdly young, Ivy; I’m half a
generation older. When I saw you outside Covent Garden
last night, I felt I’d do anything to make you less miserable.
Anything in the world. If we hadn’t been in a public street,
I’d have taken you in my arms and kissed you... I thought
and argued all the evening; I wished I had more to give
you. And I was glad for my own selfish sake that you
were unhappy. I wasn’t particularly happy myself; and I
suddenly saw that, if I could give you everything I had, if
I could make a new life, a happy life for you, Ivy, I should
be happy myself. You see, I’ve not been thinking of you
very much,” he laughed.</p>

<p class='c009'>She turned quickly and put her face up to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Kiss me now, Eric,” she begged.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will, when you’re sure you’re in love with me,—if you
ever are.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am! You know I am! I’d do anything for you. Isn’t
that love?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You don’t yet feel that I’m essential to you. That’s
why you need time. And, if you knew what love was, you
wouldn’t need me to tell you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ivy knitted her brows and looked away.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thought I did,” she murmured. “I thought I couldn’t
<span class='pageno' title='135' id='Page_135'></span>get on without Johnnie. That was why; he threatened to
go away....”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric watched her out of the corner of one eye:</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you find you can get on without him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I had to.” The answer came without hesitation, but she
paused at once to consider it. Eric wondered whether he
had heard regret in her voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If he came to see you to-night,” Eric propounded, “if he
explained away whatever happened two nights ago and said
that he’d always meant to marry you and wanted to marry
you, if he told you that it was simply a question of money—”</p>

<p class='c009'>She interrupted with a vigorous shake of the head:</p>

<p class='c009'>“You don’t understand! He’s a different man.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He <em>was</em> the man you fell in love with, Ivy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No! I’d been mistaken in him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I only want to be sure that you’re not mistaken now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m <em>certain</em> now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no profit in reminding her that she must have
felt at least as certain before she surrendered to Gaymer.
Eric concentrated his attention on the punt, which was making
slow progress against the wind and stream. As they
came alongside the lawn of the Guards Club, he saw Ivy
stiffen and look away; there was no apparent reason for her
abrupt movement, as he could only see two wounded officers,
playing with a dog, and the back of a third, who was making
his way slowly towards the club-house. Evidently she did
not want to be seen, and Eric felt a twinge of misgiving
when he reflected how little he knew of her. Whenever a
man married, he had to some extent to inherit the relations
and friends, the family bores and family feuds of his wife,
with a greater or less legacy of complications and indiscretions;
all that he knew of Ivy and her world could be written
on a single sheet of paper.</p>

<p class='c009'>Tea was a silent and reflective meal for both of them.
It was only when they had driven to the station and were
<span class='pageno' title='136' id='Page_136'></span>walking up and down the platform that he found a reason
for her embarrassment. On a bench by the head of the stairs
two officers were playing with a dog; between them sat Gaymer.
Now as before, Ivy saw him first, but this time he saw
her and bowed. Eric would have walked on, but one of the
wounded officers waved a crutch and hailed him by name.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hullo, Pentyre! I haven’t seen you to speak to since
you were smashed up,” said Eric.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I came to look you up when I was home about a
year and a half ago, but they told me you were in America.
I caught sight of you in the distance at one of Sonia’s
parties... This is a memento of the final Hun push.
You know my brother, don’t you? And Gaymer?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes!” Eric felt his heart quickening its beat.
There was an adequate nod, Gaymer rose with adequate
alacrity and bowed a second time to Ivy; but there was no
glint of resentment over their late candid meeting in Buckingham
Gate, no flicker of curiosity at finding Ivy in such
company and no embarrassment in meeting her at all.
“You know Lord Pentyre, don’t you? Miss Maitland, Mr.
Frank Pentyre.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, please don’t get up,” Ivy begged, as Pentyre and his
brother reached for their crutches.</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric was pleased to see that she was composed—as much
composed as he had been when he found himself confronted
with George and Barbara at Covent Garden; he also remembered
his own emotions that night and led her away as
soon as he could make an opportunity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well done!” whispered Eric, pressing Ivy’s arm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s go further in front,” she answered. “I don’t
want to travel up with them... Eric! I could have killed
him! So cool and collected... He <em>knows</em> how he’s
treated me, he <em>knows</em> he’s been a brute and a liar—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Steady on, Ivy,” Eric urged, as her voice became
tremulous.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='137' id='Page_137'></span>“He always frightened me, because nothing seemed to
make any impression on him. When he was flying, he was
inconceivably brave; people have told me. He’d have been
given the V. C. again and again, if any one had known.
When he crashed, it would have killed any other man, but,
though he’s not allowed to fly any more, it’s made no other
difference. He frightens me, because I can’t do anything
with him. That night—he let me do all the talking...
He’s a brute.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric was disquieted that Gaymer should have seen them
together. Most men would be glad to be relieved so
promptly of their responsibilities, but under his mask of indifference
Gaymer was capable of being piqued at finding
himself so quickly supplanted; it was almost an invitation
to see whether he could reestablish his ascendancy, a challenge
to his idleness and vanity, his taste for mischief and
his love of power.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t have anything to do with him,” Eric urged.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I want to punish him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You may only punish yourself—and me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A taxi had been ordered to wait for them at Paddington,
and they escaped with relief from the crowded train and
drove to the Cromwell Road. It was the first moment of
privacy since the morning, and Ivy caught his hand and
pressed it eagerly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Eric, I want to cry!,” she gasped, throwing her arms
around him and hiding her face on his shoulder. “I’ve
wanted to all day, you’ve been so wonderful! What can
you <em>see</em> in me? I <em>will</em> try to repay you, though I never can.
Eric, tell me it’s all true and that you’re not playing with
me!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m no good at jokes of that kind.” She had slipped
half to the floor, and he lifted her on to his knees; with a
gentle pressure she drew his head to her bosom and laid a
<span class='pageno' title='138' id='Page_138'></span>cold, tear-stained cheek against his. “Ivy, this is not my
idea of taking a month to think <em>calmly</em>—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t want a month!,” she cried, tightening the grip
of her arms as though he were trying to escape.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dear child, you <em>must</em> steady yourself! We shall be at
your father’s house in a minute, and you can’t go in like
this. Dry your eyes, Ivy darling. You said you couldn’t
see why I was doing this; don’t you see it’s because I want
you? But, however much I want you, I can’t take you till
I’m sure that I can make you happy. Wait a month—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t wait a month!”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was on his lips to say “a week,” but he stopped himself
in time. There was always a temptation to do what a
woman asked, when she was unhappy; but the one way to
make a happy woman unhappy, an unhappy woman unhappier,
was to yield to her. And in his overnight sanity,
before she fired his blood, he had promised Gaisford to take
time before risking a double tragedy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A month, Ivy,” he repeated. “You must find out the
sort of creature you’re marrying.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall never see you,” she pouted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You shall see me all day and every day, if you like.
My secretary went for a holiday on Saturday. Do you
remember once offering yourself for the position? I don’t
mind now. You can tell your aunt and say you’re coming
as a great favour to me. <em>Then</em> we shall see how quickly you
get tired of me... Sit still, you little eel!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ivy had slipped on to the floor again and laid her head on
his knees:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tired of you... <em>Tired</em> of you! I <em>love</em> you. And I
can never thank you or be worthy of you—” She stopped
abruptly and sprang up. “Eric! My darling!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The taxi came to a standstill, and he helped her out. As
they stood decorously on the steps of her father’s house, he
looked at his watch and said:</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='139' id='Page_139'></span>“Eight hours ago you were respectfully calling me ‘Mr.
Lane.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>He saw her shivering; and her eyes filled with fear:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Eight hours ago—seven and a half—I prayed that our
train might have a collision... Is her ladyship expecting
us, Henry?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Though Ivy had only once described her home—and then
in a single sentence—, one glance at the outside and another
at the hall enabled Eric to deduce the character of the occupants
and the moral atmosphere of the house. A young
footman with two wound-stripes on his livery coat took his
hat and asked whether he would like to wash before dinner.
Ivy had already run upstairs to her room, and, as he followed
the footman, Eric saw massive orderliness on every
hand. In the dim hall stood a heavy oak table, flanked by
two black oak chairs and surmounted by a presentation salver
and a rack with leather-cased Bradshaw, Whittaker and Law
List. It was painfully irregular, he felt, that doors, intended
by the genius of orderliness to be shut, should have
been left open; but he was fortunate in gaining a glimpse,
through one, of mahogany side-board and massive dining-table
set with eight heavy mahogany chairs and, through
another, of glass-fronted fumed-oak book-cases, a double
writing-table and red leather couches. The furniture seemed
to have been bought in sets and ordered by post; the books—each
surely an accepted classic, though Eric could see nothing
of them but their calf backs—might well have been
supplied by measure. The house was lighted by gas, and
each room had its accredited box of matches. The all-pervading
solemnity filled Eric with unseemly thoughts of irresponsible
humour; he longed to transpose the match-boxes
marked “HALL” and “COAT ROOM” and to see what
would happen; over the basin, as he washed, was a mirror
and shelf with two hair-brushes, one branded “J. F. M.”
and the other “VISITORS.” Perhaps Gaymer had been
<span class='pageno' title='140' id='Page_140'></span>detected changing the match-boxes; perhaps that was why he
had been forbidden the house....</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric checked the impulse to laugh, as soon as Gaymer
came into his thoughts. It was easy to understand why a
girl had been so desperately anxious to escape from such a
house, easy to imagine how she would welcome any one who
stretched out a hand to help her... But he had felt no
resentment towards Gaymer for two hours; a cad, yes, but
a cad who had made his contribution to Eric’s own destiny...
What mattered now was the remembrance of Ivy’s
ecstatic plunge into his arms, her quavering whisper and
trembling mouth, her eyes bright with unshed tears, a kiss
that sent her soul on wings to his lips. He frowned at his
reflection in the mirror and wondered whether the judge
would suspect anything....</p>

<p class='c009'>Ivy was not yet down when he was shewn into the grim,
shadow-filled drawing-room, but her mother welcomed him
with nervous warmth. As she turned to the light, Eric saw
a thin, small woman with the incongruous remains of a loveable,
baby prettiness under her lined skin and her air of
being never at ease. While Mr. Justice Maitland was still
an unproved junior, her friends murmured that she was
throwing away both herself and the snug dowry which came
to her from the family business of wholesale chemists, but
the initial advantage was first equalized and then turned
against her; the rearing of five children tied her to the house,
and her speech and outlook hinted that she had not kept
pace with her husband’s social advancement.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s very good of you to let me invite myself like this,”
said Eric, as he shook hands with her. “As I reminded Ivy,
you <em>were</em> kind enough to ask me once before, when I
couldn’t come.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s a great honour, I’m sure. And I expect you’re ever
so much run after.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='141' id='Page_141'></span>The judge laid aside the book that he had been reading
and raised himself with slow solemnity from his chair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s not our <em>first</em> meeting, Mr. Lane; you’re not likely to
remember that,” he said with austere geniality. “I knew
your father in old days and I did in fact meet you not so
many months after your arrival in this troubled world of
ours. I should like to think that your kindness to our
daughter means that you are not going to drop your early
friends now that you are famous.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The hollow click which his eye-glasses, after glissading
down his nose, struck out of his shirt-front was for a
moment disconcerting; but the bleak, formidable smile which
accompanied the words apprised Eric that his host was venturing
on badinage. He hastened to smile sympathetically,
as he took in the details of appearance and manner. Sir
James Maitland was tall and spare, with a long, blue-grained
jaw, plentiful grey hair and light, steady eyes set deep under
bushy brows. His clothes, like himself, were deliberately
old-fashioned; the loose-cut trousers accentuated his thin,
bent legs, and a low double collar gave him the hungry, long
neck of a vulture. Eric was prepared to find him pompous
and despotic in his grave moments and tedious in all; he
felt like a reveller who had strayed inadvertently into a
grave-yard where the distant fragrance and music that he
had left were swallowed in chilling mustiness and silence.
If any one for a moment ceased talking in that house, the
brooding spirit of melancholy would claim them all in forfeit.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t meet Ivy till just before I left America,” he
said. “I wish I’d seen more of her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I gather you gave her, if I may say so, very sound advice,
<em>very</em> sound,” said the judge. “She had heard the same sort
of thing from her parents more than once, but it is the
modern fashion to disregard what parents say. I’ve watched
the growth of liberty among the girls of the present day,”
he went on, as though he were delivering a considered
<span class='pageno' title='142' id='Page_142'></span>judgement and defying other courts to reverse it on appeal,
“and I can’t find a single good thing to be said for it; not a
single good thing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, <em>I</em> can!,” Eric answered. “A generation ago I’m
sure I shouldn’t have been allowed to take Ivy on the river
alone, and we should both have missed a very delightful day.
At least, <em>I</em> enjoyed it; I mustn’t speak for her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m sure she, too...” Lady Maitland turned, as the
door opened. “Well, my dear, how did you get on?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ivy looked past her to Eric and then turned to her mother
with shining eyes:</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was wonderful! Mr. Lane, you’re the perfect host,
you know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric bowed, noting from her form of address that she did
not yet propose to take her parents into her confidence.
Lady Maitland was looking closely at her, and he wondered
what inference was being drawn from the tell-tale, starry
brightness of the eyes. Magic and poetry were not dead so
long as a man could charm that soft diamond sheen from a
girl’s eyes... He discovered that the judge was asking
him a question—and wondered what inference would be
drawn from his own tell-tale absence of mind....</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was such a glorious day, it couldn’t help being successful,”
he said hastily. “We caught the eleven o’clock at
Paddington and went to Maidenhead....”</p>

<p class='c009'>He was still describing their day, when Ivy’s two sisters
entered with their husbands. Eric did not hear much of
Lady Maitland’s mumbled introduction, but one woman appeared
to be Rose and the other Myrtle. Their mother evidently
inclined towards horticultural prettiness; and the
judge had probably been very scornful when the names were
chosen. Scorn, indeed, seemed his fixed attitude of mind
towards his family; the sons-in-law forgot that they were
promising young chancery barristers and were only careful
to avoid being committed for contempt of court. One had
<span class='pageno' title='143' id='Page_143'></span>travelled from Wimbledon, the other from Beaconsfield;
they came every week like fascinated rabbits... If it had
not been the middle of the Cambridge term, Ivy’s two brothers
would have completed the ceremonial, unchanging circle...
The elder sisters had Ivy’s good looks without her rebelliousness
of spirit; in any massed attack against their
parents they would first hesitate and then surrender; marriage
was to them primarily an escape from the necessity of
making massed attacks on any one; they were their mother’s
daughters....</p>

<p class='c009'>Supper was announced; and Eric found himself between
the elder sister, who never spoke, and Lady Maitland, who
only stopped speaking when the judge drowned her voice.
As wine followed wine and course followed course, Eric felt
that rules could be framed for the legal profession, binding
its private life as straitly as the inhibitions of caste-law. At
one remove he had watched it in the days when he shared
chambers in Pump Court with Jack Waring and observed
the grub of the pupil-room, who lunched with fellow-grubs
in Hall, developing through the chrysalis stage of the newly-called
junior into the practising barrister who first marshalled
a judge and was later bidden by younger marshals
to dine with the judge in his lodgings. From his
friend’s description Eric gathered that most barristers and
all judges lived in the same kind of house, married the same
kind of wife and ate the same food. At the end of dinner
they told the same legal anecdotes before suggesting bridge.
(Mr. Justice Maitland probably disapproved of bridge on
Sundays, but he had been playing golf at Walton Heath—with
other judges....)</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric sipped a matchless sherry and sympathized with
Lady Maitland over her difficulties in obtaining butter during
the war. (A small farmer who lived near her old home in
Hampshire had been willing to supply an unlimited quantity,
but the judge felt that it was bad citizenship to exceed their
<span class='pageno' title='144' id='Page_144'></span>ration by an ounce.) Ivy was watching them silently, asking
him with her eyes whether he now wondered why she had
run away from home; no vice could be imputed to her
parents, but they were solidly uncongenial, and in his turn
Eric privately debated the possibility of being able to break
away altogether from the Cromwell Road after marriage.
To rescue her from the judge was no less important than
to rescue her from Gaymer. It would be intolerable, if he
were expected to dine there regularly; fortunately, he was
at present being treated with extravagant deference, which
shewed that a reputation still had its value; and, for a man,
economic freedom consisted in being able to patronize his
father-in-law....</p>

<p class='c009'>Strong mock-turtle soup and sherry; cold salmon and
champagne that was drinkable—and no more—(the judge
had brought it out in Eric’s honour, and it had been kept
long enough to lose its quality); cold roast beef, gooseberry
tart and cheese, followed by a bottle of ’84 Dow; it was a
plain, substantial meal, spoiled by Lady Maitland’s unceasing
efforts to make her guest overeat himself and by his own
need to talk in three keys at once. The judge asked what
the next play was to be and gave himself a cue for recalling
and describing the London stage as he had known it in his
youth (from the age of thirty he had been too busy to spare
time for the theatre, and nowadays—with certain illustrious
exceptions which he did not need to specify—there were no
plays worth seeing). Lady Maitland was still troubled by
the butter shortage and the difficulties of providing for a big
house; it was a pain of spirit, which wrung from her a
moan whenever she could make it heard; and, though the
judge dominated the conversation with his cues and speeches,
she remained resolutely undefeated with an inexhaustible
store of food-news which she poked through the interstices
of her husband’s periods.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was asked to be chairman of a committee on dramatic
<span class='pageno' title='145' id='Page_145'></span>censorship,” he explained. “That’s how I come to be interested
in the subject.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You must have some more gooseberries,” insisted Lady
Maitland swiftly, as he paused. “They’re from our own
garden in Norfolk. Fruit always seems so much nicer when
you’ve grown it yourself, don’t you think?... I was telling
you about that salmon. The price—but prices don’t
mean anything to a bachelor, <em>I’m</em> sure; you just order what
you fancy, and, if it’s not in season, so much the worse for
you.” She laughed at her own audacity. “Well, the reason
why salmon is so disgracefully dear is that ever so much has
been deliberately allowed to go bad so as to force up the
price of the rest. I always think it’s so wicked to waste
food, don’t you? With so much want about. The people
with small fixed incomes—I’m always so sorry for them.
I had a case the other day, the woman who used to teach my
girls music—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m sure Mr. Lane doesn’t want to hear about <em>her</em>,” interposed
Ivy with more solicitude for Eric than civility to her
mother. “Father, Mr. Lane’s secretary has gone away for
a holiday, and I’m going in her place.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The two sisters looked up with dawning interest; Lady
Maitland glanced covertly at Eric; the judge nodded slowly
to give himself time to think. Ivy had thrown out the announcement
without inviting his approval or opinion. If
she wanted either, it was not fair to speak in front of Eric,
but he had not adjusted himself to the new conditions of
her emancipation....</p>

<p class='c009'>“How does that work in with Connie’s arrangements?,”
asked Lady Maitland, when her husband’s silence began to
look like discourtesy to Eric.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, she can get on without me for a month,” Ivy
answered easily. “Don’t you think it will be fun?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What does Mr. Lane say?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='146' id='Page_146'></span>Eric wished that the subject had not been introduced, if
it brought so much latent antagonism to the surface.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She will be of very great assistance to me, if you’ll let
her come,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c009'>The judge reached out eagerly to take up the challenge:</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear Lane, <em>we</em> don’t control Ivy’s movements.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I shouldn’t dream of asking her to come against
your wishes. We discussed this in America, before I engaged
my present secretary.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lady Maitland was still visibly fluttered by finding Eric
at her table and discovering him to be Ivy’s intimate friend.
The wives of barristers and judges lived to as rigid a pattern
as that of their husbands; and it was part of their
guild-law to dislike the idea of any girl’s wandering off in
the morning and returning at night without giving any account
of herself or having any one to look after her. Mr.
Lane, indeed, had a big enough position of his own to make
him careful of his reputation; he seemed steady and sensible,
agreeing with almost everything that she had said....</p>

<p class='c009'>The judge felt that he had been trapped. It was no
longer possible to launch side-long reproaches at Ivy, when
the responsibility of the decision was put into his hands. As
he waited for their decision, Eric was able to break free for
a moment from their fog of timid conventionality and ask
himself what they would think if they ever guessed why he
was there at that moment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, that’s a very proper sentiment,” said the judge at
length, “very proper. I’m glad to find one person in the
house who thinks that the wishes of parents should be consulted;
I’m glad that Ivy should see that this is not merely
senile perversity or malice... I’m sure we can trust her
to you, Lane. If you could discover what we’ve done to
make life insupportable to her at home,” he added caustically,
“we shall be glad of enlightenment.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric laughed, because it saved an answer; but Rose and
<span class='pageno' title='147' id='Page_147'></span>Myrtle were sitting upright and tense in scared anticipation
of a scene, while their husbands ransacked void brains for
an attractive subject of conversation. Lady Maitland
was gamely casting back to the gross tonnage of bully-beef
wantonly wasted by the expeditionary force in the first six
months of the war; but their prompt and practised contrivance
only strengthened his feeling that he had never
seen a house in which the older generation succeeded less
in understanding and sympathizing with the aspirations, the
enthusiasms, even the follies of the young. He was sorry
for Ivy and her brothers and sisters, sorry for the common,
faded, pretty mother; but he was also sorry for the blue-jawed
judge, who was a more interesting dramatic type,
ruling like a patriarch until dumb obedience changed without
warning, so far as he could see, to flaming revolt. A bigger
man would not feel humiliated that his daughter had transferred
herself to a house two miles away in the same city,
because life at home rawed her nerves; the judge only knew
that this thing had been done, and he suspected that the whole
legal world of South Kensington was discussing it with
malicious interest.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the end of dinner, the two sisters whispered to their
husbands about trains and slipped away with a murmured
good-night. Left with an untried audience, the judge returned
freshly to the charge. While he was at the bar,
Maitland had won grudging tributes to the range and depth
of his knowledge; in his facts, if not in his law, he improvized
the little that he did not know, and the habit had
become permanent in his conversation. Before they had
finished discussing the rival degrees of hard work demanded
of literature and the bar, Eric had detached himself from
the plans of personal interest and fatigue and was surveying
his host as a study to be committed to a certain closely
guarded note-book in his safe at home. The judge conversed
methodically: he would introduce his subject with a
<span class='pageno' title='148' id='Page_148'></span>flourish like a self-conscious proprietor flinging open the
door of a room and asking his visitors what they thought of
<em>that</em>; after listening to half the answer, he would raise one
hand, beg leave to interrupt and develop his theme unsparingly,
only stopping when the chance of asking another
question promised him the opportunity of delivering another
discourse.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m afraid I shall have to be going in a moment,” said
Eric, as the judge offered him a second cigar. “I have work
to do before I go to bed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I’m very glad to have had this talk. You’ll come
upstairs?” He led the way to the door and paused with his
fingers on the handle. “Do you know a friend of Ivy’s
called Gaymer?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve met him a certain number of times,” Eric answered
easily enough.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What d’you think of him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I hardly like to give an opinion of a man I know so
little.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The judge laughed sombrely:</p>

<p class='c009'>“A good answer! You’re by no means as young and
simple as you look, Lane. Well, the reason I asked is this:
I’m making you personally responsible for Ivy and, if
young Gaymer comes round after her, I shall be obliged if
you’ll send him about his business. Half the nonsense in
Ivy’s head comes from him. They struck up a very warm
intimacy—quite unknown to her mother and me, of course!
that’s the modern method; I only heard of it from people
who were seeing them about together. So I got my gentleman
to honour me with his company at dinner; and I put it
to him—what was it all about? He pretended he didn’t
understand, but I wouldn’t have any of that. ‘I’ll thank
you,’ I told him, ‘not to behave in such a way as to cause
people to gossip about my daughter. I daresay you think
I’m old-fashioned,’ I said. ‘You may think I’m wrong,’
<span class='pageno' title='149' id='Page_149'></span>I said. ‘You may tell me that you’re only doing what
thousands of other men do; all I say is, I was brought up in
a different school.’ And I may tell you, Lane, that it was
a school in which young men had manners flogged into
them. My gentleman stared at me very saucily and said:
‘Are you asking me my “intentions”? Nineteen-nineteen!
Is that still done? I’ve been away at the war so long that
I’ve lost touch with that sort of thing.’ Well, then I rang
for his coat and hat. I’ve not seen him since; but that was
quite enough to make Ivy take his side, and I’ve never had
any doubt that he put into her head the idea of going off and
living her own life. ‘Living her own life’! How tired I
am of that phrase!...”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t encourage people to interrupt me when I’m
working, judge,” Eric reassured him.</p>

<p class='c009'>The double doors of the drawing-room were open, and,
as his head came on a level with the landing, Eric saw Ivy
sitting on a cushion at her mother’s feet and talking with
listless unconcern. She had put on her hat, and her gloves
were lying across her knees. Perhaps she was only tired
after her long day in the open air, perhaps she was goaded
beyond bearing by her father’s pin-pricks; or perhaps she
had been pleading fatigue so that he might take her away
and be alone with her... As they came into the room, her
unconcern dropped from her, and she turned with the same
sheen of adoration in her eyes. He prayed that the judge
might have missed it; he ought not to have been expecting
it, for they had been talking gravely and responsibly as
fathers of families, and Eric had been commissioned to protect
Ivy from undesirable acquaintances... Lady Maitland
had turned at the same moment, so she could not have
seen the glance; but, unless she were blind, she must notice
that Ivy was still transfigured....</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was just coming down to say good-bye! Mr. Lane,
<span class='pageno' title='150' id='Page_150'></span>what time do I come to you to-morrow? If it’s early, I
<em>must</em> go to bed now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose nine o’clock’s out of the question?,” Eric
hazarded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can manage that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then won’t you let me see you home? I was telling
your father that I’d work to finish. Lady Maitland, will
you think me very rude if I run away? It’s so kind of you
to let me come.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We were honoured to have you, I’m sure,” Lady Maitland
answered. “And now that you have found your way
here—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s too charming,” he interrupted before she could
finish the dreaded sentence.</p>

<p class='c009'>The judge said good-night warmly to his guest and less
warmly to his daughter, adding, before the doors were
securely closed, that Lane seemed a sensible, steady, decent
young fellow.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ivy offered smiling congratulations.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Eric, I thought you were never coming!,” she whispered.
“My dear, you were wonderful! Mother’s in love with
you! And you could hear what a success you’d been with
father. Was it a very terrible evening? I didn’t notice
anything except that you were there; I couldn’t see any
one else. I suppose father was disapproving of me, as
usual....”</p>

<p class='c009'>She stopped speaking, as the front door was opened for
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We must get things right with your people somehow,”
said Eric reflectively. “I think it’s awful when children
don’t get on well with their parents.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, my dear, is it my fault? I don’t believe father ever
cared for me much, but he really hates me now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If he does, it’s because he was very fond of you before...
Nature’s substitute....”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='151' id='Page_151'></span>Ivy slipped her arm through his and walked for some
moments in silence. A taxi was on the rank by Gloucester
Road Station, and they got into it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s only one substitute for love,” she whispered.
“A greater love... Isn’t that true?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope so.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll make it so.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>If</em>, Ivy. Remember that for a month—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A month! But it’ll be just the same. I shall be with
you every day. ‘I suppose nine o’clock’s out of the question,’”
she mimicked. “I’ll come at eight or seven or six.
And stay till mid-night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And a nice character I should get from your father.
He’s made me responsible for you, Ivy... Eaton Place.
And you <em>have</em> been happy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Eric, I wish it wasn’t over! Happy!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric laughed and helped her out of the taxi. Her happiness
was so radiant that he felt it could not last. As he
drove away he wondered whether she had been as radiant
with Gaymer. Such intensity of passion was frightening;
love that grew from seed to flower and fruit in a single day
might die in a single night....</p>

<p class='c009'>Ivy stood on the doorstep until he was out of sight. Eric
stared long at an unlighted cigarette and then searched his
pockets for a match. He was bewildered and a little nervous
and utterly exhausted....</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>A fortnight</span> before Whitsuntide Lord Pentyre engaged a
taxi for the day and drove round London, belatedly assembling
a house-party for Croxton Hall.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mothers aren’t fit to be trusted!,” he explained querulously
to Deganway, when they met in the smoking-room of
the County Club. “I suppose it’s the war. They’ve got
utterly out of hand... And you could always rely on mine
to collect the worst-assorted cranks, crooks and bores in the
length and breadth of Buckinghamshire. I vaguely left
things to her... You must help me out, Gerry; we’ll make
up a party of our own and freeze out the others.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Deganway called for a draft list of the guests before
committing himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“General Sir Maurice Maitland,” he read, letting fall his
eye-glass in blank dismay. “Oh, my dear, he’ll want to talk
to me about the war; no one can make him understand that
it’s <em>over</em>... Lady Maitland... She always wants to
know what I’m going to do about Russia and <em>will</em> make me
responsible for the peace conference... Ivy... Oh,
that’s the niece; Eric Lane has a wild passion for her—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I saw him at Maidenhead with her last Sunday. Happy
thought! He shall come and talk to her... I want one or
two bright souls who’ll talk to <em>me</em> and perhaps take a hand
<span class='pageno' title='153' id='Page_153'></span>in a little game of poker. You, me, Babs Oakleigh, Sonia
O’Rane, my young brother,—Amy Loring doesn’t play—the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pinto de Vasconcellos</span>....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Bobbie, <em>can</em> we bear them for the whole of a long
week-end?,” asked Deganway with misgiving. “Madame is
mortally offended with any man who doesn’t make love to
her, and the husband with any man who does. I should hate
to be knifed or garotted or whatever they do in Brazil or
wherever they come from.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know them. Margaret Poynter wished them on
to my mother.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know them either. I dine with them, and that’s
surely enough... Well, I’ll see you through with them,
if you’ll do the same for me another time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Pentyre reached for his crutches and returned to his taxi.
After drawing blank at the Eclectic Club, he found John
Carstairs at Hale’s and Eric at the Thespian. The draft list
was again submitted for approval, with Ivy’s name prominently
exposed as a bait; and, with an effort of concentration,
Eric addressed himself to the invitation. For ten days
he had been too much preoccupied to think of a world outside
Eaton Place and Ryder Street; week-end parties were
no doubt being made up; strange, half-forgotten voices summoned
him to dine and go to the opera, but he lived and
worked in a dream bounded by unconsciousness from the
moment when Ivy left him at night till the moment when she
reappeared next day.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Most of the party will be coming on Friday afternoon,”
Pentyre explained.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where to?,” asked Eric.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Croxton, of course, you idiot! Do pay a <em>little</em> attention!
You needn’t pretend you’ve never been there. Well, what
about it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric stretched out his hand for the list and, on reading it
<span class='pageno' title='154' id='Page_154'></span>again, discovered that he had read it the first time without
taking in any of the names.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should love to come,” he answered absently.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pentyre limped away in search of new victims, leaving
Eric to dine with Dr. Gaisford. An accomplice is entitled
to full confidence, and Eric had invited the doctor to receive
a report on the Maidenhead expedition; when Pentyre burst
disturbingly in on his reverie, he was wondering how much
to tell. A week had passed since Ivy entered upon her
duties as secretary; on the first day she walked sedately into
the library, as nine o’clock was striking, then listened for the
door to close behind her and fluttered into his arms.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I came so early that I had to wait outside for a quarter
of an hour,” she said, putting up her face to be kissed.
“How are you, Eric?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hardly awake yet,” he answered. “I usually dictate
from my bed, at this hour, but I didn’t want to embarrass
you, so I’m dressed long before my time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But what a shame!... Won’t you kiss me good-morning,
Eric?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He shook his head and laughed. A half honeymoon was
too dangerous an experiment with a girl who was supposed
to be considering dispassionately whether she wanted to
marry him. And, if he expected to leave England in six
or eight weeks’ time, there was abundant work to be done
first.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall <em>probably</em> call you ‘Miss Maitland’ from nine till
six,” he told her. “Do you like working with or without a
hat? I’ll shew you where I keep my typewriter and stationery
and files and things; and then I can give you enough
letters to keep you occupied till lunch-time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He was leading the way to the door, when Ivy laid her
hand on his arm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t be so horribly efficient for <em>five</em> minutes,” she
begged. “I haven’t seen you since last night, Eric! <em>Such</em> a
<span class='pageno' title='155' id='Page_155'></span>long time! And I want to be shewn your flat. I was too
miserable to see anything when I was here before.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In a day and a night she had recovered her self-respect
and composure; she had slept well, and the shadows under
her eyes had faded. Eric had not the heart to chill her
new-found happiness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Five minutes, then,” he conceded. “But we shall have
to work twice as fast afterwards. Did your aunt raise any
objection to your coming here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, she was delighted... Eric, you <em>have</em> got the loveliest
rooms. We shall live here, of course; I couldn’t bear
to go anywhere else.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>If</em>,” he warned her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>When</em>,” she amended. “Eric, why d’you insist on waiting
a month? D’you want to see if you’ll get tired of me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I just want to be sure that you know your own mind.
Sudden conversions are always dangerous. And you’re too
precious to me to be married on a snap division. So for a
month we won’t say or do anything that ties your hands in
any way. I’m not giving a hint to any one, even my own
people; I’m not proposing to make any allusion to you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Before three days had passed Eric found that it was
easier to take this resolution than to live up to it. Amy
Loring stopped him in the street to say:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hear the little Maitland girl is working for you now.
I’m so glad.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My secretary’s gone for a holiday,” he answered, unconsciously
putting himself on his guard. “Ivy kindly consented
to come in her place for a few weeks.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was told you’d taken her on permanently.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no! Who did you hear that from?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Johnnie Gaymer. He seems to have transferred his
affections to another quarter. I won’t mention names, but
a woman—she’s rather a friend of mine; at least, her husband
is; and, while he’s away, she’s been getting much too
<span class='pageno' title='156' id='Page_156'></span>intimate with Johnnie—I talked to her... And then I
talked to him. Whether it ever does any good I don’t know,
but I did tell him very frankly to keep his hands off other
people’s property. And, while I was on the subject, I told
him to leave this Maitland child alone. It was then that he
told me she’d gone to you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“His intelligence department is good,” Eric commented.
“She only came to me two days ago.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I expect Johnnie feels that his nose is a little out of
joint.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric smiled, but he was disquieted; though he saw and
heard nothing of Gaymer, he could not help thinking of him;
he had been brooding uneasily when Pentyre came into the
club; he continued to worry himself with vague doubts as he
waited for Gaisford.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I suppose I may say we’re on probation,” Eric
announced, when the doctor arrived for dinner. “I put the
whole case before the girl, the day after our talk, and we’re
taking a month to see how we get on before she makes her
final decision. I hope that may be accounted to me for
prudence. By the way, she’s working for me as secretary
for a few weeks.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So I heard.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Damnation!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor laughed and shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You know, Eric, you’re as much of an ostrich as you’ve
always been,” he said. “Either credit people with the
faculty of sight, or be philosophical and say you don’t care
what other people think.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I <em>don’t</em> care,—but it’s annoying,” said Eric inconsequently.
“How did you hear?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“From Barbara Oakleigh.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric was startled, and his expression and tone grew hard.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s very good of her to interest herself in me,” he murmured.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='157' id='Page_157'></span>Gaisford ignored the sneer and gave Eric time to recover
his urbanity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s very natural,” he amended. “I told you, when you
first came back, that you’d played far too big a part in her
life for her to let go of you without a struggle. You may
think that, after the harm she’s done, she’d keep away out of
common decency—that’s a man’s point of view—; but, when
a woman gets down to what she considers vital, common
decency has no meaning for her. The function of
woman—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What did she say?,” Eric interrupted, blowing away the
froth of generalization.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We had a long talk. She asked if I’d seen you, and I
said ‘Yes.’ How were you? I said you were better than
you’d been in ten years. Did you seem happy? ‘Very,’ I
said. (I’m devoted to Barbara in spite of everything, but
she wanted the luxury of feeling that she’d spoilt your life
and of pretending to be inconsolable about it; I couldn’t allow
that). She asked if you ever mentioned her; I said
‘no’... Then I could see that she wasn’t satisfied, for her
next question was—who was the girl who was working for
you; and was she the girl who was always with you at the
opera? I said, truthfully enough, that I didn’t know...
Be warned, my friend.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wonder how she heard,” was all that Eric would
answer; but he was aflame with resentment at the thought
that Barbara even unconsciously dreamed of overturning the
flimsy shelter which he was so patiently erecting from the
rubble and ruin of his life.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gaisford looked at him out of the corner of his eye and
saw that he was frowning. He saw, too, that, were Barbara
to question him now, he could not so truthfully pay tributes
to Eric’s health.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I wish you the best of luck, my son,” he said.
“Of course, it’s an enormous risk, but I think you do at
<span class='pageno' title='158' id='Page_158'></span>least see that; and you’re giving yourself as fair a chance as
circumstances allow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re—temperate in your enthusiasm,” Eric laughed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve reached an age when I no longer look for perfection—even
the perfect marriage,” Gaisford said at length.
“And I’ve outgrown romance. And I’ve not many ideals
left. When everything else is burnt out, I want to know
that you’ve found companionship. You’re as bad as all the
rest, Eric; at present you’re doing this for a new emotion...
I don’t <em>know</em> this girl—, but is she going to be a <em>companion</em>?
It’s an awful thing to marry some one who’s not educated
up to your standard; it’s like playing bridge eternally with
a partner who doesn’t know one suit from another.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’s—a companion all right,” said Eric softly, remembering
with a warm rush of gratitude the new colour that
she had already brought into his life. Ivy was quick and
receptive; he found her also well-read and intelligent, with
a personal standpoint towards books and ideas which she had
taken up by herself and would not surrender without a struggle;
if she picked up her generation’s catch-words, it was
because she was still too young to understand the emancipation
of which every one was talking. Best of all, she was
adaptable by nature, and he could see her moulding herself
to his form in the single hope of bringing him happiness.
“She’s companion enough to make me forget everything else—already,”
he added.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Already?</em> It doesn’t occur to you that you’re both drunk
with romance at the moment? The reason why your two-penny-halfpenny
plays are so popular is that we all love
telling ourselves stories and escaping into a world where we
can be as dramatic and romantic and purposeful and magnanimous
as a character in a book—or as you and this child
are being at this moment. Admit that you’re both enjoying
it! The heroics, the tragedy, the sacrifice—”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='159' id='Page_159'></span>“I’m making no sacrifice, Gaisford,” Eric interrupted,
soberly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re incorrigible! You were <em>bound</em> to say that! It’s
in the part. Well, well! I only beg you—because I’m fond
of you—not to make a farce of what you call your probation.
Imagine yourself criticizing some one else’s play
instead of living in one of your own. Detachment, detachment!”</p>

<p class='c009'>For the next few days Eric conscientiously tried to regard
his secretary as a soulless, amorphous machine; Ivy, however,
was made too much of a piece to work mechanically
from nine till half-past one, then give rein to her feelings
from half-past one till three and again relapse into a machine.
She toiled as though her life and his career depended
on every letter that she wrote; her eyes shone when he came
into the room; and she took in every movement of his body
and every trick of voice and speech. At the end of the day
she sprang up like a child released from school and threw
her arms round him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you <em>always</em> work like this?,” she asked him one night.
“It <em>must</em> be bad for you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t call <em>this</em> work,” he answered. “The atmosphere’s
too highly charged with Miss Ivy Maitland for that.
But I want to get my present job finished, so that, <em>if</em> I go to
America—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>When</em>,” she interrupted with a pleading smile that taxed
his fortitude. It was hardly possible to keep at an artificial
distance without robbing her of her precarious security.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll discuss that in three weeks’ time. <em>If</em> I go, I want
to go with a clear conscience.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You insist on waiting?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We can’t take any risk, Ivy,” he sighed.</p>

<p class='c009'>She pushed him gently into a chair and knelt on the floor
by his side, resting her face on her hands and looking at him
<span class='pageno' title='160' id='Page_160'></span>with an adoration which seemed still too great for her to
comprehend.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My darling, do you think I don’t love you more and more
every day?,” she asked. “I don’t <em>want</em> to wait. Sometimes
I grow frightened, Eric; I wonder if you’ll repent... I
know you love me, or you wouldn’t have done what you have
done—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you wouldn’t be a woman, if you didn’t want me to
tell you at short intervals that I still loved you. I’m trying
to get a cool judgement from you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And I don’t want to be cool or temperate or sensible.
I... I want not to be frightened again, Eric.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Her eyes, wistful with discouragement, filled with tears
and fell until he could see the long lashes black against her
cheeks. Since their return from Maidenhead, she had never
complained; and Eric was in danger of forgetting that she
had anything to fear. Putting his arm round her waist, he
lifted her on to the arm of the chair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ve nothing to be afraid of, Ivy,” he whispered,
stroking her short black hair until she grew calm at his touch.
“I shouldn’t go back on my promise, even if I wanted to.
And it happens that I don’t want to.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you <em>do</em> love me, Eric? I’ve been thinking—quite a
lot and quite cold-bloodedly. I can’t take what you’re offering,
unless you love me. It would be too much, I should
have no right... If I did anything, after this, to make you
wretched... And I <em>shouldn’t</em> take it.... You said you’d
marry me in spite of everything, but I sometimes think you’re
marrying me <em>because</em> of everything, <em>because</em> I’ve made such
a mess of my life, <em>because</em> you were divinely sorry for me.
But do you love me apart from that? If I told you that the
whole thing was a dream—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should call it a device of destiny for bringing us together...”
He stopped abruptly, afraid to trust his voice,
<span class='pageno' title='161' id='Page_161'></span>as her eyes lit up. “And, by the same test, if that <em>were</em> only
a dream, would you want to marry me?,” he continued.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“More than any one you’ve ever met or are likely to
meet?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes.” Eric sighed and lapsed into silence; for the first
time in ten days he felt sure of himself. “But I shan’t love
you a bit,” she pouted, “if you’re cold and remote when
we’re married.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If... All right, I won’t tease you, Ivy child, if it
frightens you. What can I say to keep you from ever being
frightened again? Shall I tell you that my heart and head
and everything inside me were dead until a few days ago?
You’ve brought me to life again...” He leaned his head
against her shoulder, staring into the empty fire and talking
more to himself than to her. “What d’you think it means
to me to feel that this room’s alive, alive with you? When
I’m called, my first thought is that in two hours I shall see
you. An hour and a half, one hour... When you come
in, Ivy, it’s all dark outside. It’s not what I should call easy
to work with you. I want to break the typewriter and pick
you up in my arms... Is it just a coincidence that I’ve
happened to lunch at home every day this week? Or is it
possible that I’ve been looking forward to it ever since the
last moment when we were off duty together? Is it coincidence
that I’ve been to the opera every night this week—Aida,
ye all powerful gods! and another dose of Louise—and
that I’ve sat two feet behind you so that I could see your
face lit up and knew that you were happy?” Her hand
stole down over his shoulder, and he seized and kissed it.
“And I wonder if you’ll ever guess how amazingly empty
these rooms seem when I come back at night and find you’re
not here—and <em>won’t</em> be here till next day?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I <em>know</em>. When I get back... I pray for you, Eric.
I never used to pray before. At least, it never meant
<span class='pageno' title='162' id='Page_162'></span>anything to me, but now... I thank God for you; and I feel
He understands... He understands that you’ve interceded
for me. And I pray Him to forgive me and shew me some
way of paying you back. And sometimes I pray Him to
make me patient; and sometimes, when I’m frightened, I
pray Him just to make the weeks pass quickly. Ah, my
dear one!” Her fingers tightened on his wrist, and the
voice at his ear trembled. “If anything happened to you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing’s going to, Ivy!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But <em>ever</em>? You’re sixteen years older than I am. When
I’m seventy—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ll have had more than enough of me then.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Please God, I shall die before you, Eric!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I’ll promise not to marry again,” he laughed. “Ivy,
are you too tired to take down one more letter?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My darling, of course not!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I want you to write to my solicitors. I’ve never made a
will; and, of course, I shall have to make another, <em>if</em> and
<em>when</em> we marry, but I don’t want to run even the remotest
risk. I gather that you can’t look to your father with any
certainty?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He told me so—quite definitely. If I <em>chose</em> to cut myself
adrift—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I’m going to tell my solicitors to draft a will; I’ll
leave your name blank and fill it in afterwards. Then, if I
drop down dead in the street—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t, Eric!”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was seven o’clock before he had finished, and they both
had to dress and make their way out to dinner by a quarter
past eight. Eric walked into Ryder Street to find her a taxi
and to post his letters.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you say to coming to my people for this next
week-end?,” he asked. “We won’t tell them anything, of
course, but I should like you to meet them. I’m committed
to going any way; and I can take you on the plea of work,
<span class='pageno' title='163' id='Page_163'></span>if necessary. My younger brother was away fighting, when
he came of age, so we’re celebrating it now. Will you come?
Good. We’ll discuss details at dinner; you’re coming to
this Brazilian show at the Ritz, aren’t you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame Pinto de Vasconcellos</span>? Yes, Aunt Connie’s
taking me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s hope we’re together. It threatens to be a tiresome
evening.”</p>

<p class='c009'>His dinner-party, heralded by a flamboyant card of invitation
and reinforced by the personal appeals of Lady Maitland,
Mrs. Shelley and Lady Poynter, had threatened him
for three weeks. Early in the season a taciturn and swarthy
South American had descended upon London with a wife, a
bottomless purse and inexhaustible letters of introduction.
Madame Pinto had noteworthy diamonds, vitality, an interest
in the more obvious forms of flirtation and a hunger
for entertaining. Her first letter of introduction was presented
to Lady Poynter, who telephoned to six friends in
twice six minutes: “If you will help me out with this Pinto
woman, I’ll do the same for you”; and for three weeks the
Brazilians were pushed from house to house by those who
were menaced by their own Madame Pinto—under other
names—or who had launched Madame Pintos in the past.
Gerry Deganway, whose name headed every list of those
whom it did not matter inviting to meet the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pinto de Vasconcellos</span>,
tracked them round London and sketched a map of
their progress from Belgrave Square and Lady Poynter,
where they were submerged by symbolist poets and rapidly
expelled because they “contributed nothing” to the symposium,
by way of Eaton Place, where Lady Maitland sold
them boxes for charity concerts, to Grosvenor Square and
Croxton Hall, where Lady Pentyre took them in because, in
her son’s words, she knew no better and would be kind to
any one.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thereafter gratitude or vindictiveness urged them to
<span class='pageno' title='164' id='Page_164'></span>reprisals, and for three more weeks Lady Poynter arranged
“Pinto parties” on the principle that, if her friends would
keep her in countenance on one day, she would do the same
for them when their turn came. The formula was incorporated
in the code of social honour, till a man would
more readily have malingered on the eve of an attack than
failed to succour a friend who was struck down by a Pinto
invitation. Eric had resisted for some weeks: but Lady
Poynter at last presented an ultimatum, which he saw no
means of evading.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was already a considerable nucleus when he reached
the hotel a few minutes before the advertised time for
dinner; and those who knew nothing of their host were industriously
adding to the saga collected by those who did.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why does Margaret Poynter <em>do</em> these things?,” squeaked
Deganway with a petulant glance round the company.
“She’s <em>too</em> tiresome. What she can <em>hope</em> to get out of it—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I understand she’s trying to make him subsidize a Shakespeare
theatre,” interrupted Carstairs. “Well, I mustn’t
throw stones; my old mother wants to stick him with Herrig
on a long lease. <em>I</em> think it’s a bit of a gamble, because no
one knows anything about them. The Embassy shuts up like
an oyster, if you mention their name; and the Brazilian
colony don’t seem much the wiser.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, <em>I</em> heard—Now, let me see, what <em>did</em> I hear?,” said
Deganway, letting fall his eye-glass and frowning. “He got
a contract for building a new railway and, because the contract
said nothing about bridges, he stopped short, whenever
he came to a river, and started again on the other side.
Then they gave him a new contract to build the bridges and
link up his system. <em>That’s</em> where he made his profit; but
Brazil wasn’t healthy, when he’d finished, so he bolted with
the boodle. So romantic! He didn’t bolt quick enough,
though; <em>she</em> overtook him just as the gangway was being
cast off.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='165' id='Page_165'></span>He laughed thinly; but Eric had heard enough from him
and, turning away, he found himself face to face with Lady
John Carstairs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do <em>all</em> English people make fun of a woman before eating
her food,” she said rather sharply, with a quelling gesture
at her husband, as they shook hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Only the better-bred,” Eric answered. “It’s one of the
things you have to get used to. What’s Madame Pinto like?
I don’t even know her by sight.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, she’s quite harmless, but you can’t pick up everything
in a day. I’ve been here six months and I can’t yet keep all
my own husband’s relations distinct... Ah, here they are!”</p>

<p class='c009'>She turned with a smile, as a stout, sallow woman in a
pink dress advanced apologetically into the lounge with a
tall, saturnine husband at her heels. Both looked round with
dizzy shyness, breaking into shrill effusiveness, when they
recognized a face and could fit it with an approximate name.
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame Pinto de Vasconcellos</span> spoke fluent English with a
strong accent; her husband limited himself to a bow, a handshake
and a clipped “How do you do?,” as his wife’s friends
brought up their own friends to be introduced. From time
to time, pretending to count the numbers, he peered furtively
at a type-written list, but, as Lady Poynter undertook
the introductions and never remembered more than one name,
his initial perplexity deepened to bewilderment.</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric was caught and pushed forward with a hasty, “You
know Madame Pinto, don’t you? Now, is it worth while
waiting for the Oakleighs? Barbara was born a week late,
and she’s never caught up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Though he fancied that for the last fortnight he had
forgotten Barbara and that for the last three months he had
rehearsed himself into impassivity, Eric knew that the
muscles of his face were stiffening. Lady Poynter was
happily too much preoccupied to notice any sign of embarrassment,
and in a moment he was at ease again. It
<span class='pageno' title='166' id='Page_166'></span>would be a strain on his fortitude, perhaps, if he were
placed next to Barbara; but he knew that he could meet her
and sit composedly at the same table. He knew also that
this meeting had to take place....</p>

<p class='c009'>Lady Poynter possessed herself of the type-written list and
suggested that they should begin without waiting any longer.
As he peered at the name-cards, Eric was relieved to find that
he was five places away from Barbara, on the same side of
the table, between Ivy and Madame Pinto; he was further relieved
that he was facing the door so that he would probably
see her before she saw him....</p>

<p class='c009'>As dinner began, his hostess exchanged bewilderment for
frank recklessness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not know half these people,” she confided loudly.
“I meet so many. Tell me, Mr. ——,” she reached for powdered
sugar and tried without success to read Eric’s name-card,
“the woman next to Lord Poynter; who is she?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s Lady John Carstairs,” Eric answered. “Her
husband’s on Lady Maitland’s right; and that’s his mother,
the Duchess of Ross, between your husband and Mr. Deganway.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, thank you. It is so confusing at first. I have
made the most dreadful mistakes through not knowing who
every one was.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, Lady John says she doesn’t yet know her own relations,”
Eric answered reassuringly. “She’s an American,
you know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Madame Pinto rolled her eyes in consternation:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I did not know. We met at Lady Poynter’s house, and
I said terrible things about North America. In my country—Brazil,
you know... You are not an American?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You can say anything you like to me, Madame Pinto.
Political, racial, religious... By the way, half these people
are Catholics, you know....”</p>

<p class='c009'>He broke off, as the door opened to admit Barbara and
<span class='pageno' title='167' id='Page_167'></span>George Oakleigh. Eric felt his features stiffening again,
as she looked round to identify her hostess and came forward
with an exaggerated apology. She had always dominated
any room that she entered; she dominated this one. While
she paused a studied moment in the door-way, every one involuntarily
turned to look at her; the comfortable clatter of
conversation grew still and died away, to be succeeded by
blurred cries of welcome: “Babs!” “Dear Barbara, how
sweet you look to-night!” “Babs darling!” Eric had stood
a dozen times, like George Oakleigh, a pace behind her, as
she came into the room; like him, a little embarrassed to be
late; like him, exulting in the theatrical magnificence of her
entry....</p>

<p class='c009'>Ivy touched his arm and whispered:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is that Lady Barbara? I’ve only seen her in the
distance before. Eric, how fascinating she is!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Barbara brought her apology to an end and looked for her
chair. Her eyes met Eric’s, and, as she passed him, she
shook hands and murmured, “How are you?” There was a
final spurt of welcome from the men on either side of her,
as she sat down; and Eric tried to remember what he had
been discussing before her interruption.</p>

<p class='c009'>Madame Pinto had lost no time in establishing him as her
confidant and adviser; with her second glass of champagne,
matter-of-course friendliness warmed to embarrassingly out-spoken
coquetry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are clever and nice,” she proclaimed resonantly,
darting a swift glance from under darkened eye-lashes and
touching his hand with sparkling, ring-laden fingers. “Those
two, now? Who are they?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“George Oakleigh and his wife,” Eric answered in an
undertone. “He used to be in the House—in Parliament,
you know. She was Lady Barbara Neave, daughter of Lord
Crawleigh, our Governor-General in Canada at one time,
then Viceroy of India. She’s related to almost everybody
<span class='pageno' title='168' id='Page_168'></span>here—first cousin of Carstairs, first cousin of Lady Amy
Loring....”</p>

<p class='c009'>Madame Pinto nodded vehemently until her diamonds
quivered and flashed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I remember! I met her at lunch with Lady Poynter.
And, also, I have heard of her,” she answered. “That young
man in your Ministry of Foreign Affairs—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Deganway? You mustn’t take all he says too literally,”
interposed Eric.</p>

<p class='c009'>Madame Pinto’s voice was more penetrating than she
knew; and he could see that Barbara was sitting inattentive to
her neighbours.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He said that she had broken all your hearts, one after
another... I am not surprised.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You <em>must</em> be careful,” Eric whispered in agony. “She’ll
hear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Barbara had already heard and was pretending that she
had not, galvanizing herself to an interest in her neighbour.
Madame Pinto looked down the table and saw her preoccupied.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, you are one of all those relations! I am sorry,
Mr. ——?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“An old friend,” Eric answered brusquely.</p>

<p class='c009'>Perhaps it was feminine curiosity, perhaps Madame Pinto
felt subconsciously that she was being headed off something
of interest, perhaps she had a perverse talent for the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mal à
propos</span></i>. Certainly it seemed as though nothing would satisfy
her until she had plumbed the bottomless pool of gossip in
which Deganway had submerged Barbara; and for the
hundredth time Eric wished that some one would thrash
Deganway or cut his tongue out.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hear you’re taking a house in London,” he began hurriedly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Madame Pinto was not to be so easily diverted from her
quest.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='169' id='Page_169'></span>“Mr. Deganway told me,” she pursued, “that, when she
was sixteen, a man blew his brains out, because she would
not marry him. He says that, ever since, she has expected
it of all the others.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The first part of the story’s probably untrue; the second
certainly is,” Eric answered curtly. “I know her very well,
Madame Pinto. She’s always been rather unconventional,
she’s always been greatly admired and very much in the
public eye. The result is that no story is too fantastic to be
believed about her by people who don’t know her. Deganway
<em>does</em>; and he’s no business to talk such nonsense...
I used to see a great deal of Lady Barbara before her marriage;
I look back on her friendship as one of the greatest
achievements of my life. Steele said of Lady Elizabeth
Hastings that to love her was a liberal education; I should
like to think that my friendship meant half as much to any
one.... Do you know Carstairs well? He’s in the Diplomatic,
and I believe he was out in Rio once....”</p>

<p class='c009'>The abrupt transition from low-voiced, tense earnestness
to a conversational drawl convinced even Madame Pinto that
he was forcibly dismissing Barbara from discussion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have I said something dreadful?,” she asked with an
unabashed smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Didn’t I tell you that you could say anything you liked to
me?,” he laughed. “Political, racial, religious? I only draw
the line at something personal, when it concerns a friend of
mine and doesn’t happen to be true. Deganway ought to
know better.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As he turned to Ivy, Eric glanced involuntarily past her
and was in time to see Barbara looking quickly away. She,
then, had heard, too. And probably half a dozen more on
either side, but they did not matter. He wondered whether
she would try to speak to him after dinner. She would love
the dramatic sense of humility in thanking him for his
defence....</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='170' id='Page_170'></span>“I sent my mother a line before dinner to fix up about the
week-end,” Eric announced at random. “I forget if I
warned you that my father had a serious illness last
autumn....”</p>

<p class='c009'>His family and home provided a subject for discussion
with Ivy until the end of dinner. While Madam Pinto was
talking, it seemed as though they were rivetted to their chairs
through all eternity; as soon as he was set free, their plates
were snatched away almost before they could see what had
been placed before them. Lulled by the drone of his own
voice, Eric roused with a start to hear the Duchess of Ross
asking her son whether he had room for her in his car, as she
had to be at another party by eleven. One or two of the
men looked at their watches; chairs were pushed back and
heads dived under the table in search of gloves and bags.
Barbara stood up and took in the room at a glance; and Eric
felt that her personality spread through the air like a wave
of electricity. Ivy was talking to Lady Maitland, Madame
Pinto was receiving thanks and showering <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">adieux</span></i> on her
guests; alone and apart, he was too far from any one to take
cover.</p>

<p class='c009'>Barbara began to draw on her gloves and walked slowly
towards the door. As she came opposite him, she turned
almost in afterthought, looking up for an instant before concentrating
afresh on the buttons of her glove.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was nice of you to stand up for me against that odious
woman, Eric,” she whispered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“One lie more or less hardly matters at this season, Lady
Barbara.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dear God! don’t call me that!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric had a full armoury of bitterness, but opportunity
killed any desire to use it. He had been ready to find Barbara
falsely repentant or as falsely defiant; she would perhaps
explain, perhaps scoff; he had not expected that she
would plead for mercy because he had unwittingly hurt her.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='171' id='Page_171'></span>“<em>I</em> did not seek this meeting,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You never used to be vindictive.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m doing my best to forget anything I was, anything I’ve
done.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You hate me as much as that? I thought... No, I
hoped, I <em>hoped</em> you meant it when you said that to love me
was a liberal education.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Her softly reproachful tone puffed into flame every
memory of his own three years’ suffering, which to her was
but an occasion for snatching at a compliment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If so, a liberal education has no place for romance. You
cured me of that. It was not your fault. As you know,
I’d been a semi-invalid all my life; I’d been brought up
among women who shewed me only unselfishness and devotion
and patience and sacrifice. I could trust them; they
told the truth. When you used the same terms, I thought
they meant the same things to you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She bit her lip until it shewed grey under the white gleam
of her teeth:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I hope you at least will be happy, Eric, some time.
When you are, you’ll become magnanimous again. Then
perhaps you’ll forgive me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t feel that my forgiveness plays much part in your
happiness.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I sometimes wonder if I’ve ever known what happiness
means... Good-bye, Eric.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She held out her hand and stood looking at him with eyelids
flickering as though he had struck her in the face; she was
wincing before a second blow. To act was so much second
nature to her that her attitude of unfriended humility might
be a pose; but Eric felt that, inasmuch as she had not
descended to his duel of bitterness, she had prevailed in the
encounter. He hated the whole evening, with its need to
lie in her defence and his own bursting desire to escape the
charge of magnanimity.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='172' id='Page_172'></span>Eric drew his hand away, but he could not help looking at
her flickering lids and reproachful eyes. So she had stood
a score of times when she had goaded him to madness and
his taut nerves had snapped. No longer acting, but suddenly
hurt, suddenly shocked, suddenly tired; sorry to have
maddened him, but helplessly torn and unable to let him go;
and always gently maternal, yearning to comfort, to forgive...
Her lips were parted; Eric could have sworn that
her hands twitched as though she were once more going to
throw her arms round him and seal her forgiveness with a
kiss. With theatrical timeliness he heard George Oakleigh
excusing himself from accepting an invitation....</p>

<p class='c009'>It was impossible to stop looking at her... Why George?
He wanted to fling the question at her, demanding why she
had married George Oakleigh instead of waiting, though he
knew that their love was paralysed before they parted.
Waiting would have done no good. But why George, if he
had not made her happy? She did not hint that she had
married the wrong man, but it was written in her eyes;
tragedy had come home to a woman who had played mock-tragic
parts all her life... Loneliness... Despair...
And Eric had fancied that the suffering had been all on his
side, that she had at worst been worried to know how to explain
away her treatment of him....</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thursday, yes. I don’t think we’re doing anything on
Thursday. I’ll ask Babs.”</p>

<p class='c009'>George was still juggling with his invitation: he must have
kept it aloft for hours by now... And he was coming to
draw Barbara into the game.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-bye, Lady Barbara,” said Eric.</p>

<p class='c009'>She winced again:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you need that to make yourself secure? If you
knew how it hurt! Whatever I’ve done... I haven’t defended
myself, have I, Eric? And, whatever you think of
me, won’t you say you forgive me, if I tell you that I need
<span class='pageno' title='173' id='Page_173'></span>it, that it will make a difference to me? Do you want me
to feel that I’ve killed your generosity—in addition to everything
else?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll say it, if it’s any consolation to you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, Eric. You needn’t be afraid, I’ve had my
share of education, too. I didn’t know you were going to
be here to-night; I’ve tried not to embarrass you. If it’s
any help for you to know where I’m dining and that sort
of thing... I’ll do anything I can not to make things
harder.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric shook his head quickly and looked up, as George
crossed the room. Barbara’s moment of sincerity had
passed: she had passed the half-obliterated line between
emotion and drama. Already she was weaving a romance
about the pair of them: there was to be a life’s passion
thwarted, two starved hearts beating in remote loneliness,
resignation on her side and chivalry on his, with ingenious
romantic appliances to keep the starved hearts starving; they
were to spend as much quixotic contrivance on keeping apart
as ever a pair of lovers had given to daily clandestine meetings...
A sensationalist to the core... The distraction
would keep her dramatic sense stimulated for years; in the
endless possibilities of make-believe she might forget her
tragedy. He would almost have abetted her, if so he might
forget the look of tragedy which he had seen in her eyes;
but he could not trust her....</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll take our chance,” he said. “I shall possibly be
going away fairly soon.”</p>

<p class='c009'>George was waiting patiently until they had finished.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I say, Babs, are we doing anything on Thursday?” he
asked. “Madame Pinto wants us to lunch, and I said I
thought we could.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She looked at her husband with a smile of gentle reproach:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Darling George, we’ve got the O’Ranes lunching with us.
Am I right in thinking that you’ve forgotten all about them?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='174' id='Page_174'></span>Eric bowed and turned away. “<em>Am I right in thinking...?</em>”
It was a familiar trick of speech; Barbara had
used it to him on the night of their first meeting nearly four
years ago. It hurt him to hear her using it to George,
though he did not mind her calling him “darling”. Women
were a promiscuous sex, transferring their hearts and bodies
as light-heartedly as a servant took a new situation “to better
herself”... As he passed out of sound of their voices, he
felt that this evening he had had the greatest escape of his
life; Barbara would not try to meet him again, and he could
keep her at arm’s length, if she did. He only hoped that he
would forget that look of tragedy....</p>

<p class='c009'>Ivy was waiting for him by the door, and he felt that he
owed her an explanation, perhaps an apology....</p>

<p class='c009'>“Aunt Connie’s gone home in Lady Poynter’s car,” she
announced. “She’s left her own for us. I’d better drop
you at your flat and take it on home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll just say good-bye...” He darted back and rejoined
her a moment later. “Well, thank goodness <em>that’s</em> over. Of
all the forcible feeders who outrage total strangers in the
sacred name of hospitality... Did you enjoy yourself,
Ivy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She pressed his hand, once more at ease; and he wondered
whether she fancied that she was rescuing him for herself
from Barbara.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I love being with you—as you know, you vain thing!,”
she answered. “Shall I tell you something? I went into
the dining-room before dinner and found Mr. Deganway
and Lord Pentyre working round the table. Lord Pentyre
said, ‘Any luck, Gerry? I’ve drawn Amy Loring and Connie
Maitland. Might be worse.’ And Mr Deganway said,
‘Oh, my dear, I’m between Eleanor Ross and Margaret
Poynter. I don’t think I can bear that; I shall break down
and cry.’ So he changed the cards. Well, you said you
hoped we should be together, I didn’t see why I shouldn’t
<span class='pageno' title='175' id='Page_175'></span>look after myself; so I changed places with Lady John and
put myself next to you. Were you pleased?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You badly brought-up child! Yes, I was pleased, but I
wish you’d given me Lady John on the other side instead
of the Vasconcellos woman.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He settled comfortably in his corner of the car, reminded
inevitably of the nights three years ago, when he drove home
with Barbara, discussing the party that they had left. She
was the first woman to break down the isolated self-sufficiency
of the bachelor and to teach him the indulgent
delight of sharing trivialities; and, from the day when she
dropped out of his life, he had been groping blindly for
anything that would breach the wall of desolation and silence
which was her parting gift....</p>

<p class='c009'>The car stopped at the door of his flat in Ryder Street,
and Ivy put up her face to be kissed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-night, darling Eric,” she whispered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-night, sweetheart.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As the car drove away, he stood irresolutely in the hall,
swinging his keys. A widower remarrying.... He was
beginning to treat Ivy very much as he had treated Barbara,
thinking of her and for her in the same way, using the words
which had once been sacred to Barbara. And Ivy was
fitting herself into his life as Barbara had once done...
Promiscuity was not the differentia of woman....</p>

<p class='c009'>Two days later his mother wrote colourlessly to say that
she would be delighted to see Miss Maitland for the week-end.
If she speculated on the person and destiny of a girl
whose name her son had not mentioned until that moment,
she kept her own counsel. When they travelled down to
Winchester on the Saturday afternoon, a Remington was
included in their luggage, and Eric reminded Ivy that they
must keep up the pretense that she had come to help him
with his work. Though they had rehearsed their parts,
both were a little self-conscious; and to their oversensitive
<span class='pageno' title='176' id='Page_176'></span>appreciation every one at first seemed elaborately anxious
not to betray surprise. Sybil met them at the station and
greeted Ivy with unreserved friendliness; Lady Lane welcomed
her in the hall, and, when Eric went upstairs to dress,
Basil came into his room with ingenuous congratulations.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very nice line in secretaries, old thing,” he observed,
throwing himself on Eric’s bed. “And it’s like you to keep
her to yourself, you old dog, when I’ve been mouldering for
two years in Salonica and simply yearning for refined female
society.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I took the earliest possible opportunity,” Eric answered.
“She’s only been with me a fortnight, while my permanent
secretary’s taking a holiday; and she’s only going to be with
me another fortnight.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, send her along to my jolly old office, when she’s
through with you,” Basil suggested swiftly. “You’ve simply
no conception of the sort of thing that’s blown in during the
war. Every sign of staying, too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t think she’s on the look-out for that kind of job.
I know her people, and, when she heard I was alone and
secretaryless, she very kindly volunteered to come and lend
me a hand till the other girl came back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Basil wagged his head dubiously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I call it very trusting of her parents,” he said. “Fresh
sweet English girl, young bachelor of doubtful morality,
notoriously associated with the stage... I don’t like it at
all. I think I must warn her about you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I doubt if you’ll cut much ice... Is any one dining, or
are we treating her to unrelieved family?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Warings are coming over to ease the monotony.
And, by the same token, I’d better go and dress!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Basil, then, suspected nothing; Geoffrey would think what
Basil told him to think; his father would awake to interest
when the engagement was announced—and not before.
There remained his mother and Sybil.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='177' id='Page_177'></span>Lady Lane was by herself in the drawing-room, when he
went down, and she laid aside her paper to say:</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear, what a sweet little girl! Where did you
find her?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Whether it were deliberate encouragement or not, Eric
was pleased:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I met her in America first of all. She’s a daughter of
the judge. I gather he knew the guv’nor in some prehistoric
period.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t remember the name.” Lady Lane waited, as
though she expected that Eric might have something more
to tell her; then she repeated: “A sweet little girl. You’re
lucky to find her. What’s happened to the other one?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’s only having a holiday. Ivy very kindly volunteered
to come in her place.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He used the Christian name deliberately and left his
mother to draw her own inferences. There was a second
silence; and, because she asked nothing more, he felt that,
before he left the house, he must take his mother into his
confidence.</p>

<p class='c009'>Throughout dinner he tried to keep one eye on his family
and the other on Ivy. She was achieving a marked success,
which was not confined to his younger brothers. Sybil and
the Warings made at least a show of surrender, and her
success reacted on Ivy. Though she dared not look at him,
Eric could see that her eyes were shining as on the day
when he had brought her back from Maidenhead; she was
feeling, as clearly as if she cried it aloud, that he had the
most delightful parents and brothers and sister in the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was after eleven—and late for Lashmar Mill-House—before
the Warings left. Eric waited to fasten the windows,
while his mother turned out the lights; they met in his
father’s work-room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I quite forgot to ask Miss Maitland if she’d like her
<span class='pageno' title='178' id='Page_178'></span>breakfast sent up to her,” said Lady Lane, as she collected
the day’s papers and dropped them into a basket.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She never eats any—except tea and toast,” Eric answered.
“Before you go up, mother, I should like you to
tell me candidly what you think of her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’s very young, of course,” Lady Lane answered
deliberately. She was puzzled, for he was dispassionate,
and no one else in the house seemed to suspect anything.
Eric was grateful to her for cutting all circumlocution. “I
like her, Eric, I like her immensely. She’s sweetly pretty;
I think she’s intelligent, too... You can’t expect any great
experience at that age, but then most girls of the present
day are wofully unpractical; she’ll have to learn, like the rest.
So far as one can tell on very short acquaintance, she’s a
thoroughly nice little girl... I always think a man should
try to marry a woman whose experiences are behind and
not in front of her. Of course, they’re growing all the time,
but, like children, they grow so much more quickly when
they’re very young. In that way a man’s in danger of
marrying a child and finding soon afterwards that she’s
grown into a woman that he doesn’t recognize... Have
you known her long, Eric?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No. And, while I know her very intimately in some
ways, I hardly know her at all in others. That’s why I
wanted a general, outside opinion. It’s more than possible,
mother, that I may come to you one day and tell you that
we’re going to be married.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lady Lane nodded and kissed him lightly on the forehead:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I hope you’ll be very happy, dear Eric.” His
mother was delightfully practical and restrained. She looked
out on the world with steady eyes, treating emotion as an
indecency. Eric wondered why none of her calm nerves had
descended to him. “She’s devoted to you, you’ve only to
say the word. Up to the present—?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She paused interrogatively.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='179' id='Page_179'></span>“Nothing’s fixed definitely,” Eric answered. “It’s rather
hard to explain, but there’s what I suppose you might call
“an understanding.” I can tell you this much: we’ve both
of us seen that in love it’s possible to be quite certain of
yourself and then to find, rather painfully, that you’ve been
utterly mistaken. Yes, even at her age, poor child...
We’ve both learned the lesson and paid the price; we don’t
want to make any more mistakes. I’ve burned my fingers
sufficiently to have become very unromantic... Don’t you
think we’re right to wait?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lady Lane did not know what answer to give. Since
Eric had seen the blemishes in one woman, he was looking
for them in all; soon he would see nothing else.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You mustn’t wait too long; that’s the only thing,” she
advised him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t want to take any risks.” He seemed to tell
every one that—Ivy, Gaisford and his mother.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, in marriage, risks are necessary. Marriage is always
an adventure, a blind leap. You don’t begin to know anything
about a woman until you’re married to her. Even if
you waited until you thought there was nothing more to
learn, the girl becomes a wife, Eric, and the wife becomes
a mother. Even she doesn’t see how big the change is until
long afterwards, when she has time to look back and compare.
<em>I</em> don’t want you to run any risks, my precious son.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know... And <em>I</em> want peace and quiet with somebody
I love and somebody who loves me,” he answered wearily.
“You remember the last time we had a talk in this room?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, Ivy loves you. Of course you’ve got a certain
name, a certain position; she’s a good deal dazzled by that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That isn’t the biggest factor with her... Shall we go
up? You won’t say anything about this to the others, will
you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>They walked through the hall and up the stairs, arm in
<span class='pageno' title='180' id='Page_180'></span>arm. Lady Lane paused outside the door of her room and
kissed Eric good-night.</p>

<p class='c009'>“God bless you and make you happy, Eric,” she whispered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you... I met Barbara the other night, mother.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was at a big dinner. I don’t want to meet her again;
it brought everything back much too vividly.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m afraid you’re bound to meet her occasionally.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t think she’ll try to force a meeting.” Eric passed
his hand over his eyes, and his mother looked at him with
concern. He was beginning to shew her so many familiar
danger-marks; and she prayed that he would make up his
mind before his nerves broke down again. “I may be
wrong,” he went on slowly; “it may be my colossal egotism,
but I thought that under all the vitality she was profoundly
miserable. It wasn’t an exhibition of remorse conducted
for my benefit. I think she saw that she’d made a mistake
and put all her money on a losing number. She didn’t
trouble to hide it....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, my dear, she has only herself to thank.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric shivered involuntarily:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t wish my worst enemy that degree of torture.
And I can see no way out of it for her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And, even if you could, it wouldn’t be your business.
She must lead her life, Eric, and you must lead yours.”</p>

<p class='c020'>“<span class='sc'>I wonder</span> what’s in store for us this time,” mused
Deganway, as he paced up and down the platform at Euston
with Carstairs. “Bobbie Pentyre has a genius for mismanaging
a house-party. No technique, no personality—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s not for want of experience,” interposed Carstairs
gloomily. “It must be ten years since I first stayed at
Croxton, and something has always gone wrong... The
food’s improved, but the wine has deteriorated. He knows
such odd people, too... But that’s his mother’s fault;
she finds good in every one, makes a boast of it. Lord! I
don’t see why we shouldn’t have a Monroe doctrine against
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rastaquouères</span></i>!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame Pinto de Vasconcellos</span> and Lady Maitland were
being wedged into place by their maids, while their husbands
remained on the platform to finish their cigars. Eric appeared
with Ivy and was followed by Amy Loring and Lady
John Carstairs, later by Mrs. O’Rane and her husband.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='182' id='Page_182'></span>“I didn’t know <em>you</em> were going to be here!,” cried Amy,
as she caught sight of Eric.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s not too late for me to go back, if you’d prefer it,”
he answered with a smile. “Carstairs and Gerry have decided
that it’s going to be a sticky party.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I should love you to come...” She blew a kiss to
Ivy; but a frown of misgiving settled on her face as she led
Eric away from the carriage-door. “You know John Gaymer’s
invited himself? I’m sure it’s only because he knows
he’ll meet Ivy... I do hate rows and intrigues and scenes
and schemings!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t think he’ll get much satisfaction from her,” Eric
answered reassuringly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope to goodness you’re right,” said Amy. “Unfortunately,
Johnny’s had a rebuff recently in another quarter...
Some actress, I believe... Sonia knows the whole
story....”</p>

<p class='c009'>She walked to and fro by the door, gazing anxiously down
the platform; then, on an impulse, she took O’Rane’s arm,
whispered in his ear and led him away from the others.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing serious, I hope?,” he murmured.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you can hear there’s <em>something</em> wrong!,” she
laughed. “I wish people’s voices told <em>me</em> as much... No,
I just wanted you to pull the party together as much as
possible; it’s not <em>too</em> well chosen, and poor Bobbie isn’t very
clever at seeing a squall until he’s run right into it. Do
you remember poor Jim’s last ball at Chepstow on the eve
of the war? I shall never forget how wonderful you were
in keeping things going then. So, if you <em>do</em> feel a storm
brewing...?”</p>

<p class='c009'>O’Rane nodded, and they walked back to rejoin Eric. The
last stragglers were being urged into their places and the
doors slammed, when her eyes opened wider. Looking past
her, Eric saw a man in the light-blue uniform of the Air
Force.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='183' id='Page_183'></span>“I was hoping they’d be left behind,” murmured Amy, as
she got into the carriage.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who’s with him?,” Eric asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Barbara,” she answered shortly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Some one told me she’d gone to Ireland,” he said indifferently.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No. George has only gone for two days on business, and
she’s such a bad sailor that she preferred to stay behind...
My dear Babs, you <em>nearly</em> lost the train!”</p>

<p class='c009'>A leap, a scramble and the support of anxious hands
landed the last-comers in safety, as the platform slid from
under their feet. Barbara felt her way into a vacant corner
and looked round to see who was in the carriage, nodding
easily to Eric when his turn came. She seemed so radiantly
well and happy that he wondered whether she was trying to
make him forget the damning expression of tragedy which
he had seen on her face a week before. The train was not
out of the station before she had focussed all attention on
herself, and she kept the carriage in amused subjection until
the journey’s end. Once or twice Eric stole a glance at Ivy;
but, if she felt shock or embarrassment at being with
Gaymer, she concealed it as nonchalantly as he did and listened
with the rest to Barbara’s picturesque story of a
luncheon with Gaymer, the theft of a general’s car, a scheme
for flying to Croxton, the breakdown of the car, the
beguilement of a taxi-driver from his dinner and a breakneck
drive to a barren aerodrome and from the aerodrome
to Euston. She told a story as well as ever, he found,
always shewing herself in the absurdest light; and one story
followed another until the train drew in to Croxton.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m so glad Lady Barbara’s here,” said Ivy, as they
secured a car to themselves.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She always makes a house-party go with a swing,”
answered Eric. “I say, Ivy, if Gaymer gives you any trouble,
let me know. I don’t suppose he will... But, as a matter
<span class='pageno' title='184' id='Page_184'></span>of fact, does he quite appreciate how he stands? The last
time you and he were together, you were engaged to him.
Have you ever broken off the engagement?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not in words. Except for a moment at Maidenhead, I
haven’t spoken or written to him since that night. And I
don’t want to now. I never want to see him again. If he
tried to talk to me—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You never told him why you wanted to be married
without waiting for him to be demobilized?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ivy’s cheeks flamed, and she turned her head so that he
should not see her face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“With that woman there, in the next room?,” she cried.
“I wasn’t going to beg for mercy. I left it to his honour...
And then I told him he hadn’t any honour. And he said
that, if <em>that</em> was what I thought of him—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then he still doesn’t know?” Eric persisted. “If he
comes and makes a nuisance of himself, are you going to
tell him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ivy shook her head passionately:</p>

<p class='c009'>“No! D’you think I’d look at him, if he begged me to?
He shall see that I don’t need him...” She turned suddenly
with a look of pleading in her eyes. “Eric, you won’t make
me tell him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course not! Keep out of his way as much as possible
and tell him that you simply don’t want to talk to him.
Don’t make a scene, because he’s probably more experienced
in scene-making than you are.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Though Gaymer had sat without speaking the whole way
from Euston, a feeling of tension, first experienced in advance
by Amy Loring, gradually spread to Eric and Ivy.
In spite of Barbara’s high spirits, uneasiness developed
slowly into an antagonism which was made apparent to the
sensitive hearing of O’Rane less by the words spoken than
by the significant silences. The arrival at Croxton Hall
created a temporary diversion. As Gaymer quickly
<span class='pageno' title='185' id='Page_185'></span>disappeared into the smoking-room on learning that he would
find whisky and soda there, Eric was spared all danger of
conflict with him. Ivy went at once to her room and only
reappeared under the protection of Amy Loring; Barbara
was caught and retained at the bridge-table until the dressing-gong
sounded. Despite the sombre forebodings of Deganway
and Carstairs, Eric began to feel that the week-end
might pass without mishap, though he wished fervently, as
he bathed and dressed, that it was the last night of his visit
instead of the first.</p>

<p class='c009'>When they went in to dinner, he was so much preoccupied
with looking to see who was on either side of Ivy that he
did not notice at first that he had himself been placed next
to Barbara. The discovery that she was within a foot of him
steadied his nerves like the first bomb in an air-raid. For
half of the meal he talked with composure to Lady Pentyre;
then turned and tossed Barbara the shuttlecock of their conversation,
leaving her to shew whether she was content with
safe impersonalities or whether she was still bound to improvize
a romantic drama out of their meeting.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lady Pentyre’s just been telling me that my bedroom’s
supposed to be haunted,” he began. “She’s offered me
another, without a bathroom, but I told her that all the ghost-proof
rooms in the world aren’t compensation for the exclusive
possession of a bath.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose you’ve got my old room,” said Barbara reflectively.
“I came here, the winter before the war, for the
Croxton Ball... Lady Pentyre offered it to me again,
but... I thought I’d leave it to some one who didn’t take
quite so many ghosts with him wherever he went...” She
shivered almost imperceptibly as she looked round the room,
pretending an interest in ill-executed portraits of mediocre
Pentyres, none of whom achieved higher rank than that of
colonel, commander or dean. “It was here... I told you
the story... the first time you ever dined with me... as
<span class='pageno' title='186' id='Page_186'></span>soon as I knew that you were a friend of Jack’s. I had to
get it off my conscience.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t think <em>I’ve</em> been here since Bobbie’s coming-of-age,”
Eric answered. “Several of us motored over from
Oxford: Deganway, Sinclair, Raney, Summertown...
That loving-cup on the side-table; I believe you’ll find all
our names on it—a joint present from all the other members
of the old Phoenix Club. There are none too many of
them left now,” he added with a sigh. “It doesn’t do to let
yourself see ghosts....”</p>

<p class='c009'>Barbara was paying as little attention to the history of
the loving-cup as he had paid to her reflections on the haunted
room. It was evident now that she was preparing some kind
of dramatic scene; and, though her talent was hampered by
the presence of others, he would not give her a chance of
playing a part that she might continue later in less publicity.
Eric was not likely to forget the first time that he dined
with her: with evenly balanced triumph and consternation
she had described her long and still unended duel with his
best friend. Jack Waring, it seemed, had snubbed her, and
she took her revenge by making him fall in love with her;
when he proposed, she refused him because he was not a
Catholic; when he became a Catholic, she refused him again
and then, in superstitious terror that she was imperilling a
man’s soul, swore that she would marry him whenever he
asked her again. Eric was unlikely to forget that dinner
because it was almost the first skirmish in the long campaign
by which Barbara set herself to make him too fall in love
with her; and, when she had succeeded only too well, they
discovered that her oath to Jack Waring still kept them
apart.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It doesn’t <em>do</em>...!” Barbara echoed. “You can’t always
<em>help</em> it... I think of the last time I was here... and now!
When I believed in God, I often used to think what fun He
must be having with me!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='187' id='Page_187'></span>“I can’t think God spends much time making people
unhappy,” said Eric. “They do it so well for themselves.
He has only to create a little egotism....”</p>

<p class='c009'>Barbara crumbled her bread in silence, waiting to assure
herself that they were not being overheard.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You still think it was egotism that kept me from marrying
you, Eric? It wasn’t. Fear, if you like; superstition...
I <em>had</em> promised Jack, I was ready to stand all my life barefoot
in the snow, waiting for him to forgive me... I loved
you, as I’ve never loved any one before or since; you know
that. But you wouldn’t wait. It would have been a terribly
easy way out... when I <em>wanted</em> to... The night after
you said good-bye I telephoned to Jack, I asked him to come
and see me... D’you remember abusing me because I was
<em>vain</em>? I hadn’t much vanity then, Eric. As soon as Jack
recognized my voice—it was the first time we’d spoken alone
since his release from Germany, since the war, since that
ghastly night when I swore on the Cross that, if he wanted
me, I’d marry him—he hung up the receiver. And then I
knew at last... It may interest you to hear that my famous
pride was still flourishing so vigorously next morning that I
drove round to your flat as soon as I was dressed. They told
me you’d started for Liverpool. I didn’t know your ship,
or I’d have come on board.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It might be morbid luxury of self-torture—Eric had lived
through his own nights and days of might-have-beens—, or
a despairing effort to recapture him, or a blend of the two,
or a connoisseur’s appreciation of dramatic irony; impulse
and calculation, sincerity and sensationalism were always
curiously intermixed with Barbara.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It wouldn’t have made any difference,” he answered
coldly. “Superstition, if you like... Or vanity... I
knew that night that you put something in life before love.
You were <em>afraid</em> of Jack, but you never pretended to be in
love with him... However, I don’t think these <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">post
<span class='pageno' title='188' id='Page_188'></span>mortems</span></i> do any good. Amy Loring tells me that George is
in Ireland. Is it true that he’s selling his place there?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He would, if he could find any one to buy it. We haven’t
very much money. You see, I forfeited mine by marrying
a Protestant and I don’t care to go to my family... We
may as well have it out, Eric. I married him—dear God!
I’d have married any one who spoke a kind word to me when
you went away... I’m trying to make him happy, I’m
trying to make amends to every one I’ve injured, but it’s
rather a long list.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hardly know Ireland at all,” Eric continued in disregard
of his emotional cue. “He invited me to Lake House years
ago, but I couldn’t afford the time....”</p>

<p class='c009'>Barbara nodded mechanically, by now unconscious that
he was trying to head her off reminiscent dissection, hardly
conscious that he had spoken.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s not quite what I expected of life,” she murmured
humbly. “But you... Are you happy, Eric?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perfectly, thank you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m glad. Time’s a wonderful healer. I always told
you to go away and forget me. You said you couldn’t.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I haven’t forgotten, but I’ve adjusted some of my values.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Barbara stole a glance at him and then looked away, with
eyes narrowed in pain, over the head of the man opposite
her, over the shoulders of the footman, blankly and dizzily
into the shadows at the end of the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Until humanity has no value at all...” she whispered.
“Ah, Eric... If I could wipe it all out and draw a sponge
over your memory so that we met as we met that first evening
at Margaret Poynter’s, if I could make you loving, tender—not
to me, God knows!—, if I could cure your bitterness of
spirit and teach you not to condemn all women because one
woman once wrecked your life... Eric, if you could see
yourself as I still see you that first night... like a faun,
with big startled eyes...” She found her voice rising and
<span class='pageno' title='189' id='Page_189'></span>stopped abruptly. “I think Lady Pentyre told me it was
the ghost of a woman who’d been killed in the Civil War.
You’re not afraid of ghosts?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Like everything else, they have to be faced boldly.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a moment’s deepening silence, and Lady
Pentyre caught the eyes of the women. It was only when
he was free from the tension of Barbara’s presence that Eric
realized her power. No other woman set his nerves tingling
and his blood racing through his veins, and no other woman
responded to him as Barbara did. When she flung her crude
emotionalism at him, he was still never sure of himself; a
very little more would go to his head... He looked round
the table, counting the empty chairs and calculating the
dinners that he had still to eat; with reasonable luck Lady
Pentyre would not put him next to her for another meal.</p>

<p class='c009'>A hand was laid on his knee, and he found O’Rane trying
to speak to him. Pentyre and Gaymer were arguing with
irritating heat about some trivial and forgotten aspect of
the war, and it was difficult for any one else to make his
voice heard.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Our intrepid airman is becoming the least little bit of
a nuisance,” murmured O’Rane. “I thought he was a bit
thick when he got into the train at Euston, though he didn’t
say much. I shall have to take him in hand; he used to be
quite a nice boy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric’s attention had wandered until he was hardly conscious
of his surroundings.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I... scarcely know him,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ll find him worth cultivating... when you’ve overcome
your dislike of him,” said O’Rane with a softly malicious
laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gaymer’s voice could be heard growing in assertiveness;
and, though Pentyre interrupted from time to time, his
resistance gradually weakened until he faint-heartedly cut
<span class='pageno' title='190' id='Page_190'></span>his opponent short by suggesting to General Maitland and
Don Pinto that they should all go into the drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Strategic retreat,” commented Gaymer in thick scorn.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was flushed and combative, but still master of himself;
and, as he crossed the hall and entered the drawing-room,
his manner changed. Eric watched him being absorbed into
a bridge-four with the Maitlands and Barbara; the rubber
ended without unpleasantness, and he began to wonder
whether he had not imagined all the tension which he seemed
to feel from the moment when he caught sight of Barbara
and Gaymer hurrying along the platform. It was difficult
to see what either of them could do; Barbara had already
played her scene and had not been encouraged to repeat it;
Gaymer had hardly spoken to Ivy, and he could see that she
was taking pains never to be left alone....</p>

<p class='c009'>It might be nothing but coincidence that they were all
meeting in the same house, but Eric did not want a single-handed
encounter with a man whose hostility had been latent
ever since their first meeting three years before. When the
women went up to bed, he only stayed in the smoking-room
long enough to choose a book. Gaymer threw him an abrupt
but not uncivil “good-night,” and he walked upstairs with
vague, tired relief that he had survived the first evening
without altercation. There was a note on his dressing-table:
“<i>Good-night, beloved. Sleep well. God bless you. Ivy.</i>”
He smiled and began to undress. At the end of the passage
he heard doors shutting; as he got into bed, there was a
slow clatter on the stairs, followed by “Good-night, Pentyre,”
“Good-night, General. You’re sure you’ve everything you
want?” There followed a belated “good-night” in the unmistakable
clipped utterance of Don <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pinto de Vasconcellos</span>.
Half-an-hour later Eric heard O’Rane and Gaymer coming
up and separating, with suppressed chuckles, outside his
door; their footsteps grew faint, and in another moment the
house sank into silence.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='191' id='Page_191'></span>Feeling too tired to begin a new book, Eric turned out
the light and was settling himself comfortably in bed when
he saw a square outline of yellow round the door of the
bathroom. He raised himself on his elbow with a murmur
of annoyance, when the door opened slowly and he saw a
tall figure in a loose white wrap. For a startled, uncertain
moment he remembered Lady Pentyre’s warning that the
room was haunted and Barbara’s addition that the visitant
was a woman who had been killed in the Civil War. While
he did not believe in ghosts, his hand explored nervously for
the electric-light switch; some one might be playing a practical
joke, but Pentyre was still unable to walk without
crutches, and Gaymer had barely had time to get to his own
room. Possibly—he had forgotten or neglected the geography
of the house—some one had mistaken his door.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hullo?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Eric!”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was Barbara’s voice; and his hand trembled as it turned
the switch. Her hair rippled in waves over her shoulders;
her eyes shone burningly, and the fingers that held the wrap
together were shaking; with the other hand she clung for
support to the edge of the door. Eric saw that her face was
colourless, that her bosom rose and fell with her quick breathing;
as she took a step forward, he noticed that her feet were
bare and thrust hurriedly into slippers trodden down at the
heel; and, as she moved, the dumb paralysis of surprise
left him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What on earth are you doing here?,” he cried.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hush! Eric... I was afraid one of the others might
come in, so I waited. I thought they’d never go to bed...
Eric, you think I’ve done you a great wrong—I have! I
admit it!—But, if I can’t undo the harm I’ve done....”</p>

<p class='c009'>Her eyes and voice, her stumbling steps and trembling
outstretched arms shewed that she had forgotten everything
but a consuming need of him. Eric had never before seen
<span class='pageno' title='192' id='Page_192'></span>a woman lose all control of herself, he had never imagined
that Barbara was capable of such desperation; the madness
in her eyes and the delirium of her mood appalled him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My God, what are you thinking of, Barbara?” he whispered.
“And what d’you take me for? Your husband—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll leave him and come to you! We’ll go away together!
You once said—d’you remember when I dined with you in
an air-raid?—you said you’d rather a bomb hit the house and
killed us both than see me married to any one else! I’m
here... And I’m blind with misery, Eric. I want to be
happy. I want to make you happy. No one need know...
Or, if you like, you can let every one know. I’ve made my
mistake, I’ll tell George, I’ll ask him to forgive me. He
won’t want to keep me, when he knows I don’t love him. We
can go away for a time—”</p>

<p class='c009'>She was creeping inch by inch nearer to him, and Eric
suddenly felt the touch of dry and burning fingers on his
wrist.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stop this nonsense!,” he cried, shrinking back.</p>

<p class='c009'>The grating harshness of tone sobered her a little. She
did not try to touch him again, he could see her mentally
preparing a retreat, an escape, a means of saving her face,
if he finally repelled her; he could see, too, that she did not
mean to be lightly repelled.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You usedn’t to call my love ‘nonsense’ in old days,” she
answered quietly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Things have changed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your love has changed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My love is dead.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you used to say that I must marry you, because I’d
spoiled all other women for you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric nodded slowly. It was so characteristic of her to
remember and quote, even at the most critical moment of
her life, a dog’s-eared phrase of extravagant adulation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes. And I might add that you’ve spoilt me for all
<span class='pageno' title='193' id='Page_193'></span>other women. If one came to me now without blemish,
straight from the right hand of the Creator, I should expect
to find treachery or ingratitude... Will you please go
back to your room?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He was thankful that he had stopped without saying more.
In her craving for new sensations, Barbara had some perverted
strain which made her enjoy being scourged by the
tongue of a man who loved her; and in another moment he
would have said something which would enable her to put
him in the wrong; and anything that he said gave her an
excuse for staying....</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve never tried to defend myself, Eric. You were
right... You were always right. Isn’t there room in life
for mistakes?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s sometimes no room to repair them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re still thinking of George?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s time one of us did, Lady Barbara... I try to treat
other men’s wives as I should expect other men to treat
mine.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He reached for his dressing-gown and slipped his arms
into the sleeves. When it was too late, he saw that for a
moment he was putting himself at her mercy; in that moment
she sprang forward and pinioned him:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Eric!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you kindly let go and will you kindly leave my
room?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Eric, you’re going to marry that child! You must be
mad! You’ll be as miserable as I am... If you do that,
it <em>will</em> be too late... Eric, don’t struggle, you’re hurting
me... Listen! I’ve told you it was a mistake, but it’s
not too late to put it right. We were made for each other.
You wouldn’t be blamed, and I—I should glory in it...
Listen! You <em>shall</em> listen! The other day I was at a party,
and a man I don’t know said, ‘That woman looks as if she’d
been through Hell.’ They’ll say of us that we’re in Heaven.
<span class='pageno' title='194' id='Page_194'></span>They’ll try to attack us—and they won’t be able to. We
shall be in the clouds, we shall be walking on air. People
who see us will go away hungry and envious. Eric, you
remember what it was like before that awful parting! I
lived for you, and you lived for me. Everything we did and
thought... Whenever we were ill or unhappy... There’s
never been a love like ours; and, if I didn’t see it, I see it
now. God punished me to shew me what I was throwing
away... <em>You</em> know what this last year has been, Eric;
if <em>you</em> threw away your chance of happiness—Ah, you’re
hurting me!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He had wrenched himself free of her embrace and sprung
out of bed. Barbara fell forward with her face on the
pillow. He listened for the silence to be broken: though she
had never raised her voice above a whisper, it had vibrated
with passion until he fancied that it must ring and echo
through the house. He opened the door, took a step forward
into the warm darkness of the passage and listened. When
he came back, the room seemed to be filled with the keen
scent of carnations. He saw Barbara slowly raising her head
and brushing back the hair which had fallen over her face;
she looked distractedly round the room through half-closed
eyes and threw out her arms to him; then she saw the open
door, and her arms dropped to her sides.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is a funny way for it to end,” she murmured. Eric
said nothing. “I used to believe you, too. I thought you
cared for me....”</p>

<p class='c009'>His silence daunted her, and she walked out of the room
with a sigh and a half shrug.</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric locked the door and began filling a pipe. Then he
turned on all the lights and explored bedroom and bathroom
on hands and knees. On the middle of the floor he found a
crumpled handkerchief, scented with carnation; he fingered
it irresolutely, then struck a match and tossed it flaming into
the grate. Imagination or reality still scented the room with
<span class='pageno' title='195' id='Page_195'></span>carnation, and he threw open the curtains, resting his arms
on the stone sill of the window and leaning out into a starless
night. A heavy dew was rising, and the stone was sticky with
moisture. The scent of carnations changed to a scent of
stocks; then the reek of his own pipe drowned both. He
was wakeful but calm, surprised at his own calmness before
and now.</p>

<p class='c009'>He wondered what Barbara was doing....</p>

<p class='c009'>He wondered what she would do at their next meeting.
Presumably she would invent a letter from George in the
morning, calling her to Ireland, or recalling her to London,
but they would meet later. A man, after such a misfire,
would surely go abroad for a year or two; woman seemed
to lie about these things to others—(“Eric Lane was staying
with the Pentyres. You know he used to be rather in love
with me? I’m afraid he still is, though I should have thought
that, when I married, he’d have faced facts... I wish he’d
find some nice girl... Connie Maitland’s little niece was
there, but she’s hardly out of the nursery...”)—until they
could lie about them to themselves; in a few years Barbara
would convince herself that he had broken down the locked
door of her bedroom and entreated her to run away with
him. Women could make themselves believe anything, when
they had to save their faces, to ignore a rebuff and keep up
their value in the sex-market. And, as a matter of fact, a
man did not always retire to decent obscurity; he sometimes
came, like John Gaymer, officer and gentleman, and stayed
in the same house as the girl whom he had seduced and
deserted. Seemliness of conduct, seemliness of feeling were
dead....</p>

<p class='c009'>Sleep was impossible; and he remembered with gratitude
how Lady Pentyre had arranged for him to work undisturbed.
She had made a literary picture of a preoccupied,
irregular genius who wrote under the attack of fitful inspiration;
breakfast would come when he rang for it: he
<span class='pageno' title='196' id='Page_196'></span>was not expected, he was almost forbidden, to shew himself
before luncheon; and, if he wanted to work during the
night, there awaited him a touching equipment of electric
stove, spirit-lamp, cocoa, biscuits, and cold chicken. Eric
went into the dressing-room and surveyed with a smile her
solicitous array of stationery; there was paper big and small,
plain and ruled, there were pencils and pens, india-rubber,
paper-fasteners and a chromatic riot of ink and sealing-wax.
He unlocked his despatch-box and glanced at a bundle of
manuscript; a character called Beatrice seemed to be speaking,
but he read the name as Barbara; and the lines that he
had given her were overlaid as in a palimpsest by the words
that Barbara had spoken, was still speaking....</p>

<p class='c009'>He wondered what she was doing....</p>

<p class='c009'>Work was out of the question until he had thought a little
more about Barbara. However far she fell, there was always
a lower depth. He imagined that she had reached her own
limits in marrying George, but she was prepared to be faithless
even to him, she was already faithless in spirit. Barbara
was too young and ardent of soul to exist without loving and
being loved; it was a question of time before she joined the
furtive, unsatisfied band of women who lived in more or
less open infidelity; she would go from one to another,
encouraging George to do the same so that he would have
less cause for reproaching her.</p>

<p class='c009'>And three years earlier she had seemed to walk clothed
in a white flame of purity. Was it another pose, like her
extravagant talk of devotion, gratitude, honour, sacrifice?
Her romantic emotions and phrases were culled from Italian
operas and sentimental novels; and she treated them seriously.
He told her once that she lived in “the hall of a
thousand mirrors”, donning and discarding the dress and
properties of a character, watching her reflection, posturing,
mouthing her lines—until the personality of Barbara Neave
lost outline and became a lay figure for the clothes of others.
<span class='pageno' title='197' id='Page_197'></span>Her own form and stature did not satisfy her; she must be
Isolde, Sarah Curran, Mrs. Blessington, Joan of Arc, Lady
Hamilton and, at a pinch, Messalina; which part she played
hardly mattered to her... She was without a sense of right
and wrong... A sensationalist, as Jim Loring called her
while she was playing with Jack, before she began to play
with him... or George... An emotion-hunter....</p>

<p class='c009'>The night was paling to a grey-blue, and the dawn brought
with it a chill wind. Eric found his body shivering and his
fingers stiff. He looked lazily at the array of food, too
tired to eat or drink; then he got into bed and once more
turned out the light. Was Barbara asleep yet?... Apart
from everything else, what a fool the girl was to run such
risks! If Lady Pentyre had looked into her empty room, if
one of the men had come to finish a cigar on the end of
his bed!...</p>

<p class='c009'>He rang for his tea at noon and looked curiously through
his letters. There were ten loving words from Ivy, who
disdained concealment from the servants, but he sought in
vain for any note from Barbara. Perhaps he was foolish to
expect one, for she knew that she could trust him to hold
his tongue. The thorough-paced anarchist always expected
the police to protect him from the violence of an enraged
mob....</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a shock, after he fancied that he had diagnosed her
so exhaustively, to find an unsuspected depth of impudence.
When Eric went into the garden before luncheon, he was
astounded to find her reading under a tree. The others
were working or playing golf; but she hailed him and explained
that she had stayed behind with a head-ache. Her
manner was free of challenge or appeal; she did not invite
him to play the accomplice; there seemed nothing to hide,
and in all the time that he had known her he had never
understood her less than when she lay in white skirt and
knitted silk coat, bare-headed and bare-armed, smoking
<span class='pageno' title='198' id='Page_198'></span>cigarettes and turning the pages of a book which she was
too indolent to cut. Her movements and expression were
gently provocative, as though she were trying to tantalize him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wonder—,” he began and stopped abruptly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric shrugged his shoulders and turned half away. He
was wondering where and what Barbara would be in five,
ten, twenty years’ time, wondering why he had ever been
in love with her, why she still attracted him and why he could
not bear to touch or look at her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was wondering how far it was to the links. I thought
I’d go and meet the others. They must have finished playing
by now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think I shall stay here,” she answered lazily. “It’s
cooler.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric sauntered across the lawn and through the garden,
stopping for a moment to speak with Lady Pentyre and
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame Pinto de Vasconcellos</span>, who were cutting roses.
He sauntered into a wood and sat down on a stile commanding
the pathway to the links. There was a sprawling group
by the eighteenth green, and he identified O’Rane, Pentyre
and the general. They were joined by a foursome, and he
gradually distinguished Amy Loring and Ivy, Gaymer and
Mrs. O’Rane. The sprawling figures straightened themselves,
O’Rane collected the clubs of the women, and the
party ranged itself in single file and threaded its way along
the foot-path towards the wood. Eric had been thinking so
much of Barbara during the last twelve hours that he had
not troubled about Gaymer, but, as they drew near, he looked
closely at Ivy for signs of annoyance or distress. She was
frowning a little, but it might have been a frown of fatigue,
and her face cleared at sight of him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How did you all get on?,” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lady Amy and I were beaten at the last hole,” Ivy
<span class='pageno' title='199' id='Page_199'></span>answered. “Give me a hand over the stile, Eric; I’ve blistered
my foot.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All well?,” he asked in a whisper.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ye-es,” she answered doubtfully. “I had one bad
moment. <em>He</em>—you know—came up and pretended to look
for my ball. He told me that he wanted to have five minutes’
talk with me some time; he said he’d invited himself
here specially for that. I told him as politely as I could
that I never wanted to speak to him again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What happened then?,” asked Eric.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He said it would take less than five minutes. I said it
could do no good. He said that I couldn’t tell till I knew
what he was going to say... Then I said, ‘<em>If</em> I give you
five minutes, will you promise not to bother me ever again?’”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric found his eyebrows involuntarily rising in uneasy
wonder. Ivy had shewn herself so much less valiant with
Gaymer than she had boasted beforehand; she seemed to be
cowed by him, so that she bargained and begged for mercy
instead of standing up for herself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And then?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, he wouldn’t promise. He just repeated ‘Will you
give me five minutes?’ I told him I’d think it over. Eric,
can’t <em>you</em> explain—?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He shook his head quickly:</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, my dear! You can refuse to see him, if you think
it’ll upset you; or you can see him and tell him that everything’s
over.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Eric, he <em>frightens</em> me!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you’ll have to get over that. Unless you fight him
and beat him, you’ll be troubled whenever he chooses to
make a nuisance of himself to you. When you’ve convinced
yourself that he has no more influence over you, he’ll go
away and leave you in peace. You’d better see him, but you
mustn’t let him bully you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ivy sighed and walked in silence to the house. At luncheon
<span class='pageno' title='200' id='Page_200'></span>Lady Pentyre began to make suggestions for disposing of
her guests: if they did not all know Melbury Cathedral, she
said, they ought to take this opportunity of seeing it. It
was only an hour’s run in the car; they could have tea there,
drive on to Wilmington Abbey and be back in time for
dinner.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Or, if you want to laze,” she added, “there are the two
punts....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That sounds more like me,” said Gaymer. “Ivy, what
do you say to exploring?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She hesitated for a moment, but Eric gave her no lead.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t mind what I do,” she answered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think I ought to put in a little work,” Eric told Lady
Pentyre.</p>

<p class='c009'>An hour later he watched the party dispersing. Amy
Loring had undertaken to punt O’Rane to Croxton for tea;
and, if he still entertained doubts of Gaymer, he was reassured
at feeling that Ivy would have help within call.
General Maitland and Carstairs retired to their rooms with
letters to answer; the others drove away in the car.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We shall be back for tea,” Ivy announced with an air of
summoning witnesses. “I promised to help Aunt Connie
with her letters.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric went to his room and tried to write, but his broken
night and the flooding heat of the afternoon sun made him
drowsy. He fell asleep in his chair and awoke with a start
to find Ivy bending over him and kissing his forehead.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear, there’s nothing wrong, is there?,” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No! But you looked so anxious at lunch that I thought
I’d come and tell you everything was all right. What a
darling room Lady Pentyre’s given you to work in! Or
sleep in. Were you frightfully tired, sweetheart, and did I
wake you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was only lazy. Is it tea-time?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ve had tea. And I’m supposed to be writing letters.
<span class='pageno' title='201' id='Page_201'></span>Don’t you think I’ve written them long enough? Don’t you
think you might take me on the river now?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She held out her hands, and Eric jumped up and caught
her in his arms. He had dreamed of many things, not all of
them pleasant; when he felt the light brush of lips on his
forehead, he could have sworn that Barbara was kissing him;
and the sight of Ivy puzzled him, recapturing for an instant
the fleeting cloud-wreath of a fancy that something had
happened to her, that he had lost her....</p>

<p class='c009'>“You <em>were</em> anxious, Eric?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t want you to be upset; and I didn’t want even a
shadow to come between us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It hasn’t.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They ran downstairs hand in hand, separating decorously
in the hall and then slipping through a side-door into the
garden. Reaction over her fright, the ever-new sense of
security had elated Ivy until she was happier than at any
time since their magical return to London from the river.
In a week their month’s waiting would be over; he was
already beginning to think how the announcement should
be made....</p>

<p class='c009'>“One week more!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric was startled:</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>I</em> didn’t say anything!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know you didn’t. I was just thinking—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was thinking, too—of that. Well, Ivy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bless you, Eric!... As if I didn’t know all along! As
if there’d ever been the faintest shadow of a doubt. But I
shan’t marry you unless you swear to me that you want me.
I feel I shall disappoint you so terribly, Eric; you’re so
clever and so <em>wise</em>. I never <em>think</em>... You were quite right
about Johnnie; I feel much better now that it’s all over.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He helped her into the boat and paddled into mid-stream.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It went off all right?,” he asked. “I don’t want to know
what happened.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='202' id='Page_202'></span>“But I want to tell you, I like telling you everything.”
She thought critically over her story before beginning it.
“It was curious. He seemed to start again as though nothing
had happened...” She was looking dreamily at the
nodding blue and orange irises wading a third of the way
across the stream; she did not see Eric’s involuntary shudder
and stiffening. “He began again from the time when I
asked him when we were going to be married; he actually
said, ‘You remember that talk we had one night before I
took you to the Vaudeville. You asked me how long I
thought I should take to get demobilized...’ I said ‘Yes’.
Eric.., well, I’ll come to that later. He said he’d had a
very bothering time, because sometimes, when he’s not well,
he doesn’t seem able to make up his mind about anything;
and no one in his wretched ministry seemed to know what
anybody wanted to do... He’d thought it over and he’d
decided to come out. You know his uncle, Lord Poynter,
don’t you? Well, Lord Poynter had offered him a job—a
very good job, I imagine—in the Azores Line....”</p>

<p class='c009'>She paused and regarded the irises with a puzzled frown,
still trying to examine her narrative critically.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go on,” said Eric.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, he stopped short there... He was very quiet...
He seemed to be saying that he’d made all arrangements and
everything was right and I’d been rather impatient. I didn’t
know what to say... Well, then he said, ‘The last time we
were together you seemed to have a pretty low opinion of
me. I told you that I couldn’t marry you then. I can’t
marry you now. I can’t marry you till I’ve got the job and
held it. But I’m going to get it and I’m going to hold it.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ivy looked up in surprise at the rasping interjection.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What d’you mean, Eric?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It sounds to me very like his original promise. And I
think he’s making it for the same purpose. He’s trying to
<span class='pageno' title='203' id='Page_203'></span>get you back.” He paused and then hurried on for fear
that prudence might restrain him. “He wouldn’t have
thought of you, if I hadn’t been in the way. It’s a trial of
strength against me. Go on.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ivy winced, and the pupils of her eyes dilated.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I told him that things had changed,” she explained. “I
said—it wasn’t true—I said that I’d always believed in him,
but there was a time when I was frightened... I reminded
him of everything—the night when he said ‘If <em>that’s</em> your
opinion of me, we’d better call the engagement off.’ I reminded
him of the woman I’d seen him driving home with.
He said....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He said, ‘I’ve never pretended to be a saint. When I
was knocked out in the war, I saw everything differently.
Most people would cut me, if they knew anything of my
private life; I drink too much, I do this and that... I
<em>could</em> put up a case, if I thought it worth while, but I don’t.
You knew all this the first night we met. I didn’t pretend
to be better than my neighbour, I daresay I’m a lot worse;
I don’t know and I don’t care. But I’m the same as I was
that first night. I loved you then—and I’ve never loved
another woman before or since. I asked you to marry me
then; and I’m in a position—I soon shall be, at least—to
make good.’ Then he sort of left it to me... I’d thought
of all kinds of bitter, horrid things to say, but I didn’t want
to. I think he meant it. I felt the only thing to do was to
be cold and dignified. I said, ‘There was a time when I
thought I was in love with you. I’ve changed since then.
I thought you’d broken your promise to me, I lost faith in
you. Perhaps I never properly loved you, but, if I lived
to be a thousand, I could never love you or trust you
again’... While I said it, I felt that I might be terribly
wrong, but it was—instinct. He looked at me... Then he
<span class='pageno' title='204' id='Page_204'></span>looked at his watch... Then he said, ‘We’d better be
getting back, or we shall be late for tea.’ Eric...”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>Then</em> I felt free. I felt I’d won. I felt you were right
and I should never be troubled again. I’m happy now...
Of course, I was happy before, but, when he flung himself
into the carriage at Euston... Eric, you’ll despise me, but
have you ever seen a dog being called simply to be beaten?
It <em>comes</em>. It <em>knows</em> it’s going to be beaten. And it <em>might</em>
run away. But it knows it has to come back later. I felt
that, if ever Johnnie... I felt it at lunch, when he suggested
that I should come on the river with him...”</p>

<p class='c009'>The stream was carrying them two yards down for every
yard that Eric paddled towards home. He bent over
the side for a merciful moment of eclipse and unshipped a
pole.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now?,” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When he said we should be late for tea, if we didn’t get
back, I knew I’d won,” she answered promptly.</p>

<p class='c009'>A serpentine rivulet of water ran down Eric’s arm; he
turned his head and industriously rolled up his sleeve.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good for that,” he commented. “Ivy, if you ever think
I’m behaving like a cold-blooded old man, I should rather
like you to suspend judgement for five seconds. Think of
me as a man who might have kidnapped you, when you were
so miserable that you didn’t know whether you were on
your head or on your heels; think that I’m trying to play
fair when perhaps I might play foul and still win... I’ve
forgotten what I was going to say, but, if we don’t get back,
we shall be late for dinner.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She looked at him fearlessly; and he realized that she
had not looked at him like that before.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can think of you as all that—and a lot more,” she
answered.</p>

<p class='c009'>For the second dinner Eric found himself between Lady
<span class='pageno' title='205' id='Page_205'></span>Maitland and Amy Loring; he observed that Ivy was between
O’Rane and Gaymer, but he felt no uneasiness. She
had emerged morally stronger and with enhanced personality
from her encounter of the afternoon. Gaymer shewed
no sign of disappointment or rebuff, but he was silent and
preoccupied. Eric would have given much to know what
was going on inside his head and what he made of a girl
who yielded to him and then refused to marry him....</p>

<p class='c009'>Resentment was swamped in curiosity. The fellow might
be genuinely in love with Ivy, though he modelled himself too
closely on the dramatically strong, silent man who bluffly
admitted that he was of flesh and blood like other men, that
others must take him as they found him. Or he might be
trying only to re-establish his ascendancy for a few days or
weeks until some other woman came his way. Ivy might
boast that she had won free of him, but at least she half-believed
in him, at least she had let him off without a word
of reproach, at least she was susceptible and even in danger,
if he set himself to win her back. Was this new assurance
and elation more than the response of a woman’s vanity when
she found two men equally desirous of marrying her? Eric
looked impatiently on the week which still lay ahead of him.
When their engagement was announced, Gaymer must inevitably
take himself off, but it was possible to compress a
great deal of mischief into one week.</p>

<p class='c009'>After dinner Eric went out of his way to open conversation
with his moody neighbour.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I understand you’re going to be demobilized shortly,” he
began.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s some talk of it,” was the guarded answer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What are you thinking of doing?,” Eric persisted, though
his companion put no hint of welcome into his manner.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m looking for a well-paid job with good holidays and
short hours. Do you know of any?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know of several men who started looking for just that
<span class='pageno' title='206' id='Page_206'></span>job when they went down from Oxford a dozen years ago.
But for the war they’d still be looking for it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, if you hear of anything,” said Gaymer in a tone of
dismissal, “mind you let me know. Or perhaps you wouldn’t
care to take the responsibility of recommending my name?
You expressed yourself very fluently on the one occasion
when you honoured me with a visit.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He was clearly undecided whether to end the conversation
or to pick a quarrel. Eric knew that it would be wisest to
turn round and talk to General Maitland, but Gaymer always
employed a contemptuous insolence of manner which roused
any combativeness that his audience might have.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did I say anything that wasn’t justified?,” Eric asked
with an effort of memory.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose it’s a matter of opinion how far any one’s
justified in interfering with other people’s business. But,
as that seems to be the serious occupation of your life, you
can’t be too thorough. I recognized that then, you remember;
I begged you to drop in at cocktail-time whenever your
feelings were too much for you. I suppose you’ve been too
busy to come.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No. I felt that, whether it was my business or not, you
at least had dropped out of it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gaymer removed his cigar and stared dully at the glowing
end.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, you seem to have been very busy with my name
behind my back,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m not aware of it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh? It was an impression I got.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can you remind me what I said?,” asked Eric.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I haven’t the least idea. You seem to have been doing
very efficient propaganda against me. Weren’t you in the
Propaganda Department at one time?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes. And my experience there was that the propaganda
which you carry out against a nation never compares with
<span class='pageno' title='207' id='Page_207'></span>the propaganda which a nation carries out against itself. One
good <cite>Lusitania</cite> outrage was worth months of our solemn generalizations;
that shewed the world what the Germans really
were.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gaymer yawned openly:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I daresay you’re right. I’m not a good judge of backstabbers.”
Eric smiled and refused to be roused by the
word. “I admit that I sometimes wonder now, as I wondered
then, just where you come in.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think I told you that I was a friend of one of the
parties.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But does that justify you in telling lies about me to the
parents of one of the parties? I only ask for information.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I never met or held any communication with either parent
until some days later. Then I said that I did not know you
well enough to give an opinion about you; it was untrue,
but I erred on the side of generosity. All this was months
after you had been invited to leave the house.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gaymer turned away without troubling to answer, and
for the next two days they only exchanged formal greetings
when they could not avoid each other; but there was already
so much tension in the house that a little more or less made
no difference. Barbara stayed until the end of the party,
talking without embarrassment to Eric and looking him
frankly in the eyes. Amy Loring, who knew as much of
their relationship as any one, betrayed neither surprise nor
curiosity. The Maitlands, who welcomed Eric as cordially
as they repelled Gaymer, presented an attitude of stolid indifference
and would have been artistically astonished if any
one had hinted that the two men were fighting a subterranean
duel for Ivy. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame Pinto de Vasconcellos</span> tried to compromise
every man in turn, and her husband glowered
silently at her frantic failures.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think it was so sweet of you all to come,” said Lady
Pentyre complacently each evening. “I do <em>hope</em> you’re
<span class='pageno' title='208' id='Page_208'></span>enjoying yourselves. I was thinking that <em>to-morrow</em>, perhaps...”</p>

<p class='c009'>She would then concentrate on the first attentive listener,
suggesting expeditions and ordering cars indefatigably. The
prevailing chill of misgiving had not spared her in the early
days of her party, for Mr. Justice Maitland had begged her
not to facilitate meetings between Ivy and Gaymer at her
house; but what could a woman do, she asked herself, when
a man buttonholed her son at the last moment and said that
he had nowhere to go for Whitsuntide? She remembered,
too, that years ago, when there was so much gossip about
the O’Ranes, Sonia had run away from her husband and
billeted herself at Croxton; she had invited the two of them
without really being sure that they went about together. As
Bobbie complained or boasted—in his silly way and without
trying to help her—, the smallest Croxton party could be
trusted to produce one catastrophe and three scandals; but,
so far as Lady Pentyre could see, every one was now getting
on very happily with every one else; and she had reached
an age when she aimed less at positive success than at the
avoidance of disaster.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the end of each day Ivy reported to Eric all that she
had done. There was little enough to say, for Gaymer had
never tried to be alone with her since she gave him his
dismissal on the river. As the train drew near London, he
did indeed join for a moment in the general discussion of
plans and ask her as a matter of form whether he was likely
to see her again soon.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m very busy at present,” she told him. “I daresay you
know that I’m trying to make myself useful to Mr. Lane
while his secretary’s away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t know you were still doing that,” he answered
without interest.</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric drove with the Maitlands to Eaton Place and took
Ivy on in their car to his flat.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='209' id='Page_209'></span>“Thank goodness! <em>That’s</em> over!,” he exclaimed, when
they were alone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Were you afraid there’d be a scene?,” she asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There were—several, only you were spared them. I suppose
it was inevitable. But in five days’ time—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s only four and a half now.”</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>As</span> Lady Maitland’s car drove away from Euston, Carstairs
set himself to divide the luggage and find seats for
the rest of the party. His wife was sent with Madame Pinto,
Amy Loring with Barbara; he himself arranged to share a
taxi with Deganway to the Foreign Office.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What are you going to do, Gaymer?,” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m going to have a drink,” was the answer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We can drop you in Buckingham Gate,” suggested Mrs.
O’Rane.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gaymer sat moodily on his suit-case, beating his cane
against the side of his leg.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do I want to go there?,” he yawned. “Well, I suppose
it’s as good a place as any... I’ll drop you first and take
the car on.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As they headed for Westminster, Mrs. O’Rane reviewed
the house-party with a critical eye, while Gaymer stared out
of window and her husband assembled and sorted such
impressions as had come to him from words which were
intended to cover feelings and from voices which broke
through the disguise of words. The men and women who
talked to him still made play with gestures and expressions
which he could not see; they forgot to keep their voices
mechanical; and, even without Amy’s warning that they
must be prepared for storms, he could have deduced a state
<span class='pageno' title='211' id='Page_211'></span>of tension from half-heard changes of tone, from hesitations
and accelerations, from shrill notes of self-betrayal and
unctuous rolls of insincerity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We <em>must</em> make Bobbie Pentyre take a little more trouble
before we go to Croxton again,” cried Mrs. O’Rane. “His
parties are such a hideous jumble. That appalling Pinto
woman! I won thirty-five pounds from her at poker, but
I’d pay twice that not to meet her again. And fancy asking
Babs and Eric Lane at the same time!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think that’s all over, Sonia,” said her husband.</p>

<p class='c009'>A murmur of lowered voices had reached him the first
night at dinner; and, though he could not hear the words,
he guessed from Barbara’s tone that she was testing her
strength and that Eric was holding himself detached. It
was safe to assume that there had been a scene of some kind,
for on later days, when they spoke at all, Eric’s voice was
apprehensively frigid and Barbara’s unnaturally composed.
No one else seemed to have noticed anything, and any gossip
centred round Eric and Ivy. O’Rane suspected antagonism
here between Gaymer and Eric; however they spoke when
they were alone, there was a frozen politeness of voice when
any one else was present. Gaymer, presumably was in love,
for his tone wakened to warmth when he talked to Ivy; and,
presumably, his suit was not prospering, for, when they returned
from the river, he had hardly spoken at all.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Maitland child was working hard,” said Mrs.
O’Rane.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’s being hunted into it by the family,” said Gaymer,
breaking silence for the first time. “She doesn’t get on
with her own people—small blame to her!—, and Connie
Maitland doesn’t want to be stuck with her for all time; so,
when a man with a certain amount of money comes along—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’ll get him easily enough,” interrupted Mrs. O’Rane.
“No man of thirty-five is proof against innocence and bobbed
hair. They think they’re renewing their youth; and, if
<span class='pageno' title='212' id='Page_212'></span>they’ve made fools of themselves already, they imagine a girl
of eighteen will be nice and tractable... And eighteen
adores the wisdom of thirty-five and loves to think that
purity and youth have won the day against experience. I had
a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">succès fou</span></i> when I was eighteen; nine old men proposed
to me in one week, and seven of them said that I was like
a flower with the dew still on me. The only one I cared for
had a wife already; he didn’t call me a flower, but he knew
enough of women to be dangerous. I’m sure Eric Lane calls
the Maitland child a flower; and, when she grows up, she’ll
be so bored that she’ll run away with the first man who
knows that women aren’t flowers....”</p>

<p class='c009'>O’Rane retired within himself and continued his analysis.
Gaymer was certainly in love; too prudent to betray himself
by attacking a rival, he soothed his own troubled spirit by
pretending that Ivy Maitland, if not in love with him, was
at least not in love with any one else. Sonia—to judge by
her voice, though no one saw her stealthily examining her
reflection in the strip of glass opposite her—was just old
enough to be jealous of a girl ten years younger, who was
beginning to attract men by her looks and youth rather than
by artifice or qualities of mind. And, if the Maitlands were
indeed forcing Ivy into marriage, no compulsion was needed
on the other side; though Eric had talked to every one, his
voice too became animated only when he was with Ivy....</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, here we are,” said Mrs. O’Rane, as the car came
to a standstill. “D’you like to take it on or will you come
in for your drink, Johnny?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gaymer sat for some moments in silence, as though unable
to make up his mind to do anything.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, never refuse a good offer,” he answered at length,
as he dragged himself out of the car.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Help yourself, then. I’m lunching out and I must change
my dress.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In the moment that she took to hurry into the house and
<span class='pageno' title='213' id='Page_213'></span>glance at her letters, Gaymer watched her with a new, impersonal
interest. His eyes followed her as she ran upstairs
humming to herself. Less than three years before, it was
commonly believed that she had quarrelled with her husband
and run away with another man; tiring of him, apparently,
she had come back. It was curious that women could dart
to and fro like this; in his own experience he had always
been the first to tire and he had never gone back to a woman
after passion, drearily cooling, had at last mercifully died;
if his passion for Ivy had cooled, he could not now return
to her, but she had broken away while she still amused him,
while his power over her was strongest, while he had only
to rouse her jealousy in order to make her do whatever he
wanted....</p>

<p class='c009'>A faint fragrance of violets lingered in the hall, provocative
as the broken music of Sonia’s voice when she sang to
herself overhead. Though he had always found her too
metallically sure of herself to be attractive, Gaymer felt
resentfully that he was being denied something that other
men had and that ought to be his. O’Rane was waiting for
him in the library, but he was bored with the company of
men. Softness of voice and touch, lightness of step, sweetness
of body, yielding gentleness... A man was incomplete
without woman....</p>

<p class='c009'>He walked into the library and mixed himself a drink.
Women were too near animals to be civilized, but they were
pleasantly domesticated. Pink tulips on every table, great
branches of lilac bursting from both fire-places... And
his senses had brought with him that faint fragrance of
violets. Gaymer wondered what O’Rane had done when
Sonia ran away and left him with memories and a ravening
hunger. The world was full of women, but their love was
impermanent; you could not buy or steal a substitute if it
was your wife who had left you... Or Ivy, who was as
much your own as a wife....</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='214' id='Page_214'></span>“A drink for you, O’Rane?,” asked Gaymer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, thanks. I can smell things, but my taste is not
what it once was... I don’t want to seem inhospitable,
Gaymer, but you’re drinking <em>much</em> more than’s good for you.
It’s a sound rule only to drink when you’re at the top of your
form; otherwise it’s a waste of good liquor and ruination of
a good constitution.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gaymer drained his tumbler and refilled it. The decanter
rattled, as he put it down on the tray, and he transferred it
to the table-cloth so that he could help himself again, if he
desired, without attracting his host’s over-acute attention.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can drop it any time I like,” he boasted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then drop it now,” O’Rane suggested. “Apart from
health, you aren’t doing yourself any good. I hear you’re
looking out for a job, and it’s only fair to warn you that
you’re getting a bad name with men and women. D’you like
candid advice?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t mind it from you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I should clear out of this country. There’s too
little work for you, too much drink and too many women.
Your record in the war was too creditable to fritter away in
bars and promenades. Take a couple of years to steady down
and then come home and get married. You’re not fit to
marry till you’ve got your nerve-centres back in place.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gaymer refilled his glass and replaced the decanter carefully;
the syphon was a noisy complication, so he dispensed
with it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I haven’t the least idea what I want to do,” he yawned.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, you want to be a decent member of society.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not in the least! Before the war I wanted to make
money and have a good time; I enjoyed the war because I
liked flying... and I liked killing. There was no ‘thin red
line’ about me; I wasn’t risking my skin for the people here.
It was good fun, though and I believe I killed more French
than Germans. Now I want to have a good time again.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='215' id='Page_215'></span>“And what constitutes a good time?,” asked O’Rane.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I don’t know. The usual things... Human
nature’s constant.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And it’s amazing how soon human nature gets tired of
wine, women and song. Short of sudden death, you’ve a
long life before you still; you must aim at something permanent.
And the only permanent things you’re going for
at present are cirrhosis of the liver and general paralysis...
Were you in love with this Maitland child?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gaymer turned in his chair so quickly that he upset his
tumbler; as he picked it up, he wondered if O’Rane knew
that blindness alone saved him from having the remains of
the brandy thrown in his face... After a moment’s industrious
mopping, Gaymer looked up and was bewildered
to find his ill-temper evaporating. Criticism, advice and
questions were jerked out with a naked candour which
mysteriously robbed them of offence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’s—a pretty kid,” he answered carelessly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve never seen her, of course. She’s nothing more?”
asked O’Rane.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was quite fond of her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing more?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m fond of her still.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing more?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gaymer impatiently broke three matches before he could
light his cigarette.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What more d’you <em>want</em>?,” he asked petulantly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, does she or any woman mean enough to you to
make you want to be a decent member of society?...
That’s your fourth brandy! Yes, I know you spilt one...
That’s why I said you weren’t fit to marry yet. Would you
knock off drink and give up hanging about with every other
woman you see and start in to earn a decent living?”</p>

<p class='c009'>A patter of light feet and a rustle of clothes heralded
Sonia’s return. She hurried to the writing-table, kissing
<span class='pageno' title='216' id='Page_216'></span>her husband on the way, rummaged among a litter of papers
and hurried out again, leaving the same faint fragrance of
violets as a provocative reminder of her presence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m rather out of favour at present,” said Gaymer, as he
stood up and began to inspect the room with critical envy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There are other women in the world. This one’s much
too much of a child for you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m not so sure. I’d do a lot for—for a woman I loved.
Oh, I’d be the complete reformed character,” he added with
a laugh that was a contemptuous antidote to his sincerity of
a moment before.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I’m glad to see that you have one vulnerable
spot... It’s time to pull up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gaymer looked at him for a moment without understanding.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wonder what you’re trying to get at..,” he murmured.</p>

<p class='c009'>Refusing the offer of a seat in Sonia’s car, he strolled
towards Buckingham Gate and arranged to have his luggage
collected from the O’Ranes’ house. There had been
no purpose in going there, no purpose in declining the lift,
no purpose in anything. He could not make up his mind or
decide what he wanted to do next. After ordering luncheon
at home because he did not want to meet people at his
club, he countermanded the order and set out aimlessly
across the Park. The government offices were emitting a
stream of girl-clerks, and he paused to watch them with disfavour;
other women were curiously unattractive at this
moment... One o’clock... He too must have something
to eat....</p>

<p class='c009'>Instead of walking to his club, Gaymer found himself
halting irresolutely at the corner of Ryder Street. It was
in one of these houses that Ivy worked now; at any
moment she might come out, he could invite her to lunch
with him... He waited for half-an-hour and then turned
<span class='pageno' title='217' id='Page_217'></span>disgustedly into St. James’ Street. Ivy was not coming
out. Eric Lane had taken possession of her with so much
assurance that no one else was allowed to see her....</p>

<p class='c009'>An errand-boy swept round the corner on the wrong
side of the road and sent his front wheel over Gaymer’s
toes before overbalancing with basket and bicycle. Gaymer
surveyed him dispassionately for a moment and then
broke into such abuse that a crowd began to collect. The
furious rush of foul language eased a pressure which was
becoming unbearable. The boy was scared, the onlookers
were cynically amused; amusement changed to inarticulate
sympathy as Gaymer paused, drew breath and started again;
he was still hurling maledictions when boy and bicycle had
disappeared from sight, and the idlers raised a murmur of
sympathy as a white-whiskered admiral intervened in defence
of decency.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mind your own blasted business, curse you!,” Gaymer
roared in savage delight at finding a new antagonist.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Another word, and I give you in charge for using obscene
language,” threatened the admiral.</p>

<p class='c009'>The crowd, which was beginning to disperse, collected
again and raised a subdued cheer in support of the old man.
“Quite right too!,” Gaymer heard. “Perfectly disgusting...
Ashamed of himself...” He filled his lungs for
an annihilating attack on them all; but, before he could
deliver it, Carstairs elbowed his way through the onlookers
and demanded to know what was amiss.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Swine of a boy runs his bloody machine over my
toes...,” Gaymer began.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, don’t make such a row about it! Come to the
club and have some lunch.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gaymer directed a last furious look at his muddy boots,
then turned from Carstairs and walked rapidly down Piccadilly.
He would have liked to tell the interfering old
admiral what he thought of him; he would have liked to
<span class='pageno' title='218' id='Page_218'></span>thrash that damned boy, to thrash any one... Cursing
him was good in its way, but he had been stopped before
he attained any satisfaction....</p>

<p class='c009'>The desire for food had passed; but Gaymer reached his
club in time for a drink and felt better for it. The desire
for a fight remained. In the open noon of his life as a
soldier he had never known this maddening itch of truculence.
To be able to call some one a German!... He
prowled through the smoking-room in search of a victim,
but people would only say “Hullo, Johnny! Coming to
join us?”... And he had already been reported to the
committee and forced to apologize “for conduct unworthy
of a gentleman” in the card-room....</p>

<p class='c009'>At five o’clock he returned to Ryder Street, only remembering
when it was too late that he had not yet looked
for Eric Lane’s number in the directory. Ivy must come
out <em>some</em> time!... Unless she spent the night there...
Gaymer checked in his short, loathed beat, for this was a
question that had to be faced and answered. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Imprimis</span></i>, all
these writers—and especially the fellows connected with
the stage who could blackmail a girl before they would give
her a speaking part—helped themselves to anything that
came their way; they were an immoral lot, but a man did
not need to be a plaster saint in order to feel that some
forms of immorality were worse than others, that the lethal
chamber was the only place for the long-haired gang who
pretended to be <em>above</em> the ordinary rules... Lane did
not grow his hair long, he had been taken up by quite
decent people; but what was true of all was true of one.
He posed as a delicate idealist—with the caressing voice
of a woman and a soulful, ‘not-long-for-this-world’ look
in his eyes; so familiar was the pose become that Gaymer
had been deceived by it into thinking he had nothing to
fear. The fellow talked “spiritual beauty” to a little fool
<span class='pageno' title='219' id='Page_219'></span>like Ivy until he won her, soul and body... And all
the time looking like a parson....</p>

<p class='c009'>Gaymer rang at the nearest door without looking at the
number. He <em>might</em> have the luck to meet Ivy; failing that,
he could always bait the parson-poet... Somewhere inside,
a clock chimed seven, and he flung away in disgust
without waiting for the door to be opened. Two hours!
Ivy was home by now. Two hours walking up and down
that forsaken street because a consumptive-looking Grub
Street hack had walked off with the girl that he wanted...
What could she see in him? Gaymer caught sight of his
own sturdy, well-groomed reflection in a shop-window. In
the name of Heaven, what could she see in the fellow?</p>

<p class='c009'>It was still broad daylight, owing to this accursed “summer
time”; and London was never so intolerable as by day.
He walked aimlessly along Piccadilly and up Regent
Street, along Oxford Street and up Tottenham Court Road.
His course would be a zig-zag on the map... Zig-zag...
Everything was zig-zag; purposeless, wearisome... He
remembered suddenly that he had eaten no food all day.
Zig-zag... His feet had strayed out of Tottenham Court
Road into a side-street, and he found himself staring at a
newly painted shop-front. Inside, a band was playing; appetizing
savours of hot food floated up from the basement;
and women with arms white and eyes darkly mysterious in
the gathering dusk pattered through the door-way with a
half-glance back in universal invitation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s this place?,” Gaymer asked the commissionaire.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fleur de Lys Dance Club, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I want to be a member. Make up a name for me
and fix it with the secretary. Add my subscription to the
dinner-bill and keep this for yourself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Without waiting for an answer, Gaymer walked through
the hall, threw his hat on to a counter at the end and
mounted to a gallery overlooking a garish green-and-gold
<span class='pageno' title='220' id='Page_220'></span>ball-room. Dinner was being served at small tables round
three sides of the gallery; in the fourth was ensconced a
negro band. Gaymer looked and listened, forgetting himself
for a moment in his effort to classify the place and the company.
Cheap and tawdry, he decided, without even the
appearance of spontaneous hilarity; respectable, in all
probability... The men looked like clerks earnestly aping
the life of gaiety and wantonness created for them in illustrated
papers and cinematograph theatres. The women,
presumably, were typists, milliners, hotel clerks, mannequins.
In cut and material their clothes were too good to
have been bought new; here and there a draggled flounce
or soiled shoe hinted at long service. Gaymer had always
wondered what girls did with their cast-off finery....</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a new world peopled by an unknown race, and he
was uncertain of the technique for gaining admittance. At
the table nearest to him a girl was sitting alone, and he
asked leave to join her.</p>

<p class='c009'>She did not know whether to be flattered or affronted
that he had addressed her; and Gaymer was confirmed in his
contemptuous diagnosis of the company’s narrow respectability.
As she lacked experience and dignity to assert
herself, he decided that she would respond to treatment
which took her for granted. He smiled and sat down with
confident composure.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m waiting for my friend,” the girl answered doubtfully,
looking past him to the door.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gaymer inspected her critically. She was young, dark
and anæmic with thin arms and a thin back bare to the
waist; her extravagantly low-cut dress was incongruously
rich half-covering to the meagre body which it so generously
revealed, but she had abundant hair, warm lips and restless
dark eyes. He looked away for a moment at the other
women in their neighbourhood and decided that he had
<span class='pageno' title='221' id='Page_221'></span>done well in choosing her; then he looked towards the door,
trying to identify her “friend”.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re not with that bandy-legged Yid, are you?,” he
asked with disfavour, as a man left the door and approached
their table.</p>

<p class='c009'>The girl looked at him in open-mouthed surprise.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Please not to speak like that about my friend!,” she
exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ll enjoy yourself much more with me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We—haven’t been introduced... And I can’t give him
the go-by,” she answered uncertainly, impressed in spite of
herself by his assurance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is a table for two,” said Gaymer significantly,
picking up the wine-list. “What are you going to
drink?... God, what assorted poison! We’ll try the
champagne; if it’s not fit to drink, we can fall back on an
honest brandy and soda. What are you going to eat?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Calling to a waiter, he began ordering dinner and was
still absorbed in his task when the “friend” touched his
shoulder and murmured deferentially:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think you’ve taken my chair, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gaymer glanced up for a moment and then turned to his
study of the wine-list.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t like Jews,” he observed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This lady... I had to see about a ticket for her—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t like Jews,” Gaymer repeated. “Waiter! Where
the devil’s our waiter gone to? Here, a bottle of forty-three.
And ice it properly first.” Then he looked up
again at the man whose chair he had taken. “I’ve spoken
about this before. Will you go away?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The man stared at him for a moment, flushed and turned
to the girl.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll find another table, Gracie,” he said with a tremble
in his voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gracie’s dining with me,” said Gaymer. “She’s much
<span class='pageno' title='222' id='Page_222'></span>too good for you. If you go away at once, there need be no
unpleasantness. If you persist in butting in where you’re
not wanted...” He paused to recollect his encounter with
the errand-boy in Piccadilly, the fruitless hours of patrol
in Ryder Street... “I shall send you to Abraham’s bosom
at such a pace that you’ll come out the other side.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The young Jew hesitated and looked appealingly at the
girl.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t want a scene—” he began.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ll get one unbroken film from here to the nearest
mortuary, if you’ve not gone in fifteen seconds,” said Gaymer,
laying his watch on the table. “One, two, three,
four....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m going to speak to the secretary,” said the young Jew
with dignity. “Bear witness, Gracie! <em>He</em> started it!...
Chucked out! That’s what’ll happen to you, sir!”</p>

<p class='c009'>As he hurried away, Gaymer breathed luxuriantly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s a pity there’s not more lynching in England,” he
observed, “but I’m glad I came in time to keep him from
molesting you any further.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You didn’t ought to have treated him like that,” giggled
the girl, who had enjoyed every moment of the altercation
and was now looking furtively at the door in the hope of
seeing her cavalier returning with the secretary. “He’ll
never speak to me again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He certainly won’t while I’m here. And, if I have any
trouble, he’ll never speak to any one this side of the
grave... Go to him, if you prefer it,” he added brusquely.
“So far as I know, I’ve never killed a Jew yet. One ought
to, just for the experience.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The things you say!,” cried the girl. “I’d—like to stay,
only poor Mr. Lewis... You scared him away, <em>no</em> mistake...
Champagne. Shall I go all funny if I drink it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope so,” Gaymer answered, raising his glass
<span class='pageno' title='223' id='Page_223'></span>cautiously. “God! it’s like treacle! Waiter, if you’ve any
brandy fit to drink, bring it here!”</p>

<p class='c009'>As his rival did not reappear, Gaymer cast about for
other means of distraction. Once again he had been disappointed
of his fight; and there was no satisfaction in accumulating
the spoils of victory without a struggle. It
was something, indeed, that he could “scare away” another
man and win over a woman by a mere word; but the
woman was not worth trouble... and the man was only fit
to thrash....</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s your other name, Gracie?,” he asked abruptly.
“What d’you do with yourself all day? Tell me all your
absorbing life-history.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Under the influence of the champagne, which he left her
to drink by herself, the girl’s tongue was loosened; and,
though he paid little attention to what she was saying,
Gaymer learned before the end of dinner that she was confidential
typist to an export merchant, that she lived at
Tottenham and that she was at that moment supposed to be
spending the night with another girl from the same office
and going to a concert. The young Jew was book-keeper
in a neighbouring office and had long desired to marry her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I keep him at a distance,” she confided. “I want
to have a look round before I settle down. No sprees
then,” she added regretfully.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Married life’s what you make it,” said Gaymer. “Come
and dance.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Dinner had put him in good humour, and he was now
less contemptuously critical. Gracie had a certain elemental
charm, holding herself well, walking well and, as she
danced, melting into his arms until she seemed a part of
him. The champagne had brought colour into her cheeks,
and her eyes shone in ecstasy. The crash and jerk, the
bleating and rumble of the band sent a thrill of dancing
madness through her nerves, and at Gaymer’s touch she
<span class='pageno' title='224' id='Page_224'></span>shivered and became still as though she were a bird and his
hand had closed over her fluttering wings....</p>

<p class='c009'>After a riot of rag-time the orchestra subsided into a
waltz.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you—could care—for me,” she hummed, “as I—could
care—for you-ou....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t!” Gaymer snapped.</p>

<p class='c009'>She was all right until she opened her mouth; but, when
she spoke, there was commonness without depravity. He
doubted whether she was clever enough to shake off her
accent, her phrases, her devastating gentility. And, if she
never spoke, there was little companionship in the adventure.
Already she was giving him a foretaste of what their relations
would be... mechanical, soulless, without intimacy
or tenderness; they danced for ten minutes and then went
back to their table in the gallery for a drink and a cigarette,
then danced again. And, whenever the music stopped, he
had to keep her from talking....</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wonder what’s happened to Mr. Lewis?,” she murmured.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t bother about him... I say, Gracie, have you
had enough of this? I’m as hot as hell in these thick
clothes. Let’s get some air.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where are you going to?,” she asked, as he led her into
the hall.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ll talk about that later. Get your cloak.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The girl stopped short and looked at him, her eyes
charged with fear.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I... I must go home,” she stammered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Get your cloak,” Gaymer repeated. “I’ll try to find a
taxi.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They drove down Tottenham Court Road without speaking.
Gaymer was tired, restless and bored, the girl fascinated
and terrified. Once she laid her hand on his wrist
and asked with dry lips where he was taking her.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='225' id='Page_225'></span>“Home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t ought to!... I <em>mustn’t</em>,” she cried.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gaymer put his arm round her thin shoulders and kissed
her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t you want to?,” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t ought to.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He withdrew his arm and lay back in his own corner:</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s a free country. Don’t come if you don’t like.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a second silence, and the girl turned to him
timidly, putting her hands on his shoulders and looking at
him through a mist of tears.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m frightened,” she whispered. “Be nice to me! Do
you want me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gaymer kissed her mechanically and with contempt for
her cheap surrender. He had asserted himself against the
young Jew and against this girl, but the proof of power
brought him no satisfaction. For a week or two Gracie
might amuse him; then they would grow tired of each other,
there would be recriminations and a scene, he would have to
find some one to take her place. And, while she was with
him, she had nothing but her meagre looks and the servile
passion which he had inspired. They might live together,
but he would never deign to share his life with her....</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is it far?,” she asked. “I’m so tired.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gaymer did not care whether she was tired or not;
nothing that she could say or do would rouse him to tenderness;
nothing that could happen to her would stir him to
concern. She was useful, she could never be essential; a
servant to be engaged and replaced. He despised her because
she could give him no companionship; very soon, he
knew, he would loathe her....</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you’re tired, you’d better go home,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You <em>are</em> horrid to me!,” she whimpered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sorry! But it’s all a mistake.” He tapped on the
window until the taxi stopped. “I’m going to get out.
<span class='pageno' title='226' id='Page_226'></span>You take this on home. Give this to the man. Kiss me
good-bye and part friends! You <em>have</em> enjoyed yourself,
I hope. Good-bye, Gracie.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He thrust a note into her hand, opened the door and
walked rapidly away. The driver waited and then came to
the window for orders; he was lazily amused to see a girl
sitting forward with her cloak on the floor and her hands
locked between her knees, staring in bewilderment at the
vanishing form of her late companion. Her lips were
parted, her eyes strained; she shivered and pulled the cloak
over her bare shoulders and back; the movement seemed
to break a spell and she roused to give an address. As
the taxi turned, she took a last look over her shoulder, then
dropped her head between her hands to think; at the same
moment the driver looked around with a leer at her expression
of perplexity, in which a wave of disappointment
was succeeded by a wave of thankfulness and then a second
wave of disappointment. She chewed petulantly at a
corner of a crumpled handkerchief, then hid her face and
began to cry.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gaymer walked south, girding at himself. Nothing that
he could do was right... He was mercifully rid of a
woman whom he might well have strangled before morning.
But he was not rid of the maddening loneliness which had
tortured him all day, racking him with an extra twist every
time that he saw a man and girl perambulating arm-in-arm....</p>

<p class='c009'>At two o’clock he found himself once more in Ryder
Street, pacing up and down for no better reason than that
he had already paced up and down there for so many
hours. Ivy could not be there at two o’clock... He
turned into St. James’ Street and crossed the Park to Eaton
Place, led thereto by instinct and well knowing that he would
find no satisfaction in staring at a blind window. It was
more than time for him to be in bed, but he could not
<span class='pageno' title='227' id='Page_227'></span>muster courage to enter his flat. Too many reminders of
Ivy lingered to haunt him in each derisory void room. A
game thrown away through carelessness... He could
have held her; granted opportunity, he could recapture her
as easily as he had captured the yellow woman with the
silly name at the counter-jumpers’ carnival off Tottenham
Court Road....</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a pity to let that young Jew escape without a
hiding....</p>

<p class='c009'>A pity that he had not thrashed that errand-boy....</p>

<p class='c009'>Gracie was not the girl that he wanted, but she was
better than nothing. And he had let her go....</p>

<p class='c009'>Three o’clock....</p>

<p class='c009'>Gaymer walked to Jermyn Street in the grey chill of a
summer morning. He did not greatly want a Turkish
bath, but it would be good for him after the indifferent
liquor that he had been consuming all day. And he could
sleep for a few hours. And Jermyn Street was convenient
for the parson-poet’s flat....</p>

<p class='c009'>Before he began the bath he must remember to look up
the fellow’s address in the directory....</p>

</div>

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>Ivy</span> always appeared so punctually that, on the morning
after their return from Croxton, Eric was first surprised
and then disquieted when nine o’clock, half-past nine and
ten struck and there was still no sign of her. His hand
was stretched to the telephone, when she came in breathless
and apologetic.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I couldn’t get here before. Don’t be angry with me,
Eric,” she begged, as she took off her gloves and hat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was only getting rather anxious,” he answered.
“There’s nothing the matter, is there, Ivy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No. Yes. No... I ran into Johnnie opposite
Buckingham Palace, and he insisted on walking across the
Park with me. That’s what made me late. We sat and
talked. I thought it best to thresh the thing out once and
for all and to have done with it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The brisk voice and businesslike manner were not
wholly convincing; as she smoothed her hair, Eric saw that
she was flushed and still out of breath.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What did he say?,” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, he told me he could explain everything, and I’d
promised to marry him, and he wanted to marry me, and
<span class='pageno' title='229' id='Page_229'></span>I’d <em>got</em> to marry him... He was frightfully in earnest.
He said I was the only girl he’d ever cared for in the least;
and I hadn’t been reasonable, wanting to marry when he
hadn’t anything to marry on and then making a quarrel out
of it. He vowed that he’d never have looked at that woman
or at any other woman, if I hadn’t refused to see him. I
did, you know; I wanted to punish him, so I wouldn’t have
him near me for a month; it was during that time that I
found out... He said that, after all we’d been to each
other, I <em>must</em> marry him, I couldn’t marry any one else, I
was practically married to him already... I said I
couldn’t discuss it with him. But I wish he didn’t take it
so seriously... Let’s get to work, Eric; I don’t want to
think about it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She shivered slightly and took her note-book and pencil
from a drawer. Eric turned to his letters without saying
anything more. She had grown suddenly pale, and her
hands were trembling; obviously unfit for work, she was
still less fit for sitting still and brooding... Since Gaymer
had clearly contrived this meeting, he meant business; there
was nothing more likely than that he would contrive a
second and third. Eric stopped in the middle of a letter
and looked out of the window, but the street was empty.</p>

<p class='c009'>“D’you feel you’ve made him see that everything’s over
between you?,” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve told him so again and again, but he simply pays
no attention,” she cried tremulously. “He keeps going back
to my promise, as though the only shadow of difference between
us was that he was so slow and I was so impatient.
He says he’ll marry me as soon as Lord Poynter’s offer is
confirmed, and I can publish the engagement as soon as I
like. I told him I didn’t <em>want</em> to, I said I wasn’t engaged
to him any longer; then we started again at the beginning...
Eric, don’t let’s talk about it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They returned to the letters, and he went on dictating until
<span class='pageno' title='230' id='Page_230'></span>he discovered that Ivy was paying no attention to him.
One hand supported her head; with the other she was drawing
little patterns on the blotting paper. Suddenly the
pencil slipped from her fingers; he saw her eyes close and
her lips whiten, as she bit them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My child—!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s nothing! I shall be all right in a minute, but I felt
so funny all of a sudden.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you in pain?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am, rather....”</p>

<p class='c009'>She bit her lips at a new spasm, and Eric put his fingers
on her pulse. Then he picked her up and carried her into
his room, leaving her there for a moment, while he gave
orders for a bed to be made up in his spare room and telephoned
for Dr. Gaisford to come round at once.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m <em>really</em> all right, I just felt funny,” she protested,
when he told her what he had done. “I think meeting
Johnnie, you know... I don’t want a doctor.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She tried to sit upright, then fell back, covering her face
with her hands. Eric took up his stand half-way between
the window and the bed until he saw a car stopping at the
door. The sight of the doctor’s familiar, burly figure
heartened him, and it was only as he ran downstairs and
found himself, white-faced and agitated, being mistaken
for the patient, that he realized how frightened he had been.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When you’re not ill yourself, you’ll always take some
one else’s illness on your shoulders,” grumbled the doctor.
“I’ve never seen such a fellow! Where is she?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In my room.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And what’s happened?”</p>

<p class='c009'>As best he could, Eric described Ivy’s sudden collapse.
The doctor raised his eyebrows once and grunted to himself:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Right. Then you can go out for a nice long walk. I
shan’t have you in the room and I don’t want you fussing
<span class='pageno' title='231' id='Page_231'></span>about outside. Come back after lunch, and I’ll give you
a new set of orders then. It’s possible that we shan’t be
able to move her for some time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But is she bad? You haven’t seen her yet!,” Eric cried
inconsequently.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can make a guess what the trouble <em>may</em> be. Now clear
out, my son, and don’t pull a long face. It’s a thing that
may happen to any one—any one who’s fool enough
to be a woman, that is. I don’t propose to let her die, if I
can help it, so you needn’t summon the relations. The less
said to them—and to every one—the better for your young
friend.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He entered the bedroom, leaving Eric mystified and
fidgetting with anxiety in the hall. There was a kindly,
gruff, “Well, my dear?” and an inarticulate answer from
Ivy. Eric hovered on tip-toe outside the door, waiting to
be handed prescriptions or sent for brandy. He looked into
the spare room to see whether the bed was yet made. “Miss
Maitland’s a little faint,” he explained easily enough to the
servants. Then he started and turned away, for across
the hall and through an open and a closed door came an unmistakable
moan. It was not repeated, and he lurked uneasily
in the hall, trying to distinguish the mutter of voices.
Then he went to his cellar and opened a bottle of brandy.
Gaisford was a fool to keep him out of the room; he could
not possibly know where anything was kept... Eric
hurried into the library and wrote—“<i>In the cupboard under
my wash-hand-stand you’ll find</i> <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sal volatile, eau-de-cologne</span>
<i>and aspirin. Also bicarbonate of soda and bismuth. I’ve
got brandy here. Let me know if there’s anything else you
want.</i>” He twisted the paper into a thin spill, pushed it
under the door and knocked gently.</p>

<p class='c009'>Half-an-hour later Dr. Gaisford came into the library
with the paper crumpled in his hand and a smile puckering
his eyes and mouth.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='232' id='Page_232'></span>“I thought I said something about a nice walk,” he
grunted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is it anything serious?,” asked Eric, disregarding the
hint.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘<i>Bicarbonate of soda and bismuth</i>’,” read the doctor.
“How old are you, Eric? Six? Seven? It’s a very
ordinary business; and there’ll be no danger, if we are
careful; but I somehow don’t think <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eau-de-cologne</span></i> quite
meets the case, my learned colleague. I’m going to write a
note, and you’re going to take it away in a taxi and bring
back a nurse. That child’s not to move for three weeks.
She won’t want to, for a day or two, because she’s in considerable
pain; and, after that, she’ll be very weak. And,
after that,—well, you may feel that Providence has stepped
in and solved a good many future difficulties for you. It’s
a curious thing—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is she in danger?,” Eric interrupted, as the doctor’s
meaning became clear to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We-ell, it’s worse than a cut finger and not as bad as
a broken back. Perhaps I may be allowed to point out
that you do no good to any one by getting into a panic.
I’ll tell you that she needs careful handling; and we’ll
leave it at that, because that part’s my job. But you’ve to
keep your head and lend me your inventive and dramatic
genius. We’ve to concoct a convincing lie over this. What
are we going to say is the matter with her?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric sat heavily on the arm of a chair, too much numbed
to think.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I leave that to you,” he answered with a helpless shake
of the head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then I make it appendicitis. We must study our parts;
she must have been troubled with pains and sickness, and I
recommended an immediate operation... We’ll make a
good lie, while we’re about it; I happen to know that Fitz-William
is ill and Greenaway’s fishing in Ireland; they’re
<span class='pageno' title='233' id='Page_233'></span>the obvious men, so we’ll say we tried to get them to
operate; when they couldn’t come, I said we daren’t wait
and I’d operate myself. You, meanwhile, tried to telephone
to the girl’s mother, but the line was engaged. I
think that holds water... I’ll get hold of a nurse I can
trust and explain to her... Can you pick any holes in
that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is it all right as regards the law?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, unless she’s inconsiderate enough to go and die.
I don’t put my name to a false certificate to oblige you or
any one, friend Eric; and, if it were anybody else, I
wouldn’t touch the whole business with a pole. But, if
she pulls through—as she’s going to—, we don’t do any
good by telling the truth and we don’t harm any one but
ourselves by telling a good, saving lie. Give me a sheet of
paper and a pen. And, when you’ve got the nurse, go off
to this girl’s mother and pitch her this yarn. She can come
and see her for a moment, if she insists, but you can quote
all my degrees and decorations to her and say that I’m very
strongly against it. Now, d’you think that’s clear?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He dropped into a chair by the writing-table without
waiting for an answer. Eric stood for a moment, trying
to remember and understand all that he had been told; then
he fetched a hat and stick and returned for the letter.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was six o’clock before he accomplished his last commission
and drove back to Ryder Street. On reaching the
Cromwell Road, he was informed that Ivy’s mother was at
the house in Norfolk; he hurried to the Law Courts and
waited for the judge, who wasted half-an-hour before deciding
to do nothing. Then he laid siege to Eaton Place,
pursued Lady Maitland round London by telephone and
eventually intercepted her between two committees in Westminster.
She wasted only twenty minutes in a succession
of agitated questions; and by that time Eric had made his
story polished and convincing, so that she accepted the
<span class='pageno' title='234' id='Page_234'></span>doctor’s ban without protest, only insisting that she was
to be fed with morning and evening bulletins. The nurse
had by this time taken charge; Gaisford had left and returned;
Ivy was in as satisfactory a state as could be expected.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose nothing will induce you to let me see her?,”
said Eric.</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor shrugged his shoulders and smiled grimly:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, if you won’t excite her. We’ve carried her into
your spare room, away from your infernal telephone contraptions.
Don’t try to talk to her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric went in and returned swiftly, with a scared face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I say, she’s in horrible pain,” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know. I sent you in to cure you of any desire to go
back. The best thing you can do is to keep out of the
way and find some work to do; otherwise you’ll simply
fret your nerves to ribbons. It’ll be much worse than this
when you’re married, if that’s any consolation. Go and get
some dinner and find some one to take to a music-hall.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric knew that the doctor was trying to keep his emotional
temperature low, but he winced involuntarily at his
inhuman detachment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“While she’s like that? Thank you, Gaisford,” he
answered shortly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m trying to make a philosopher of you,” the doctor
explained.</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric looked at his watch and walked aimlessly downstairs.
He had forgotten to eat any luncheon, and Gaisford’s
suggestion of dinner made him conscious of a head-ache
and a vague feeling of sickness. He was dawdling
irresolutely in the shadowy hall, trying to decide whether
it was better to continue hungry or to face conversation at
the club, when he heard his name called and looked up to
find John Gaymer standing in front of the name-board
by the fire-place.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='235' id='Page_235'></span>“I was coming to return your call,” he announced.</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric realized dully that he wanted, above all things, to
avoid an altercation. The head-ache told him that; he
shuddered at the thought of noise and the effort of reining
his temper and barbing his tongue for a wrangle. He had
a head-ache, because he was hungry; he was hungry, because
he had been about Ivy’s business all day. And Ivy
was in such pain that he could not bear to stay in her room.
Gaymer—and Gaymer alone—was responsible; he was responsible
for her agony of mind and of body; he would be
responsible, if she died. It was hardly the moment for him
to thrust himself into what, for all Gaisford’s bluff confidence,
might at any moment become a house of death; it
was hardly the atmosphere or mood in which to force a
gratuitous quarrel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m afraid I’m going out,” said Eric with an effort to
avoid copying the veiled bellicose tone of his companion.
“I didn’t have any lunch, so I’m dining rather early.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, don’t let me keep you. Shall I find Ivy upstairs?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric looked thoughtfully at the composed face and powerful
frame, wondering why he took the trouble to study him
so carefully and realizing with a shock that he was gauging
his strength for the moment when they had to fight this
out. He wished that he felt less empty and sick. One well-placed
blow over the heart from Gaymer’s ready arm would
probably kill him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’s upstairs,” he answered. “You can’t see her,
though.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What a slave-driver you are!,” Gaymer laughed. “I
only want to speak to her for a minute.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s impossible.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gaymer raised his eyebrows slightly and felt for his
cigarette-case. He looked vainly for a chair and then
hoisted himself on to a table beside the fire-place:</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='236' id='Page_236'></span>“I’ll wait till she comes out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you’ll have to wait some time. She’s not coming
out to-night—or to-morrow—or the next day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m afraid I shall have to go up and see her, then. I
quite appreciate that you don’t want me to disturb her
work, but you can’t very well sequester her person for days
on end.” He got slowly off the table with a swagger of
defiance, keeping his eyes on Eric and moving, with his
head turned, towards the stair-case. “There’ll be some one
to let me in, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s a doctor and a nurse to keep you out,” Eric
answered without moving. “Ivy’s very seriously ill, you’ll
be interested to hear. She mustn’t be worried, and I can’t
allow any noise of any kind... Perhaps you’d better come
out with me. There are one or two things which I think
you’ve a right to know, because, if that child dies, you’ll
have murdered her as surely as I’m standing here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gaymer’s foot was already on the lowest stair, but he
first hesitated and then came slowly back.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You mustn’t allow your love of the dramatic to run
away with you,” he sneered. “What’s the matter with
her?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll tell you outside. Are you coming? I warn you
that, if you try to get into my flat, I’ll send for the police.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He held open the street-door, and Gaymer passed through
it jauntily after just enough deliberation to shew that he
was not yielding to a threat. Eric walked half a pace
ahead of him down St. James’ Street and into the Park.
Once Gaymer broke the silence to ask where he was being
taken; Eric strode on without answering until he found two
empty chairs under a secluded tree.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m glad to have this opportunity of talking to you,”
he said. “It must be understood that I can’t let Ivy be
molested by you any longer. You made a great nuisance of
yourself at Croxton and again this morning—”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='237' id='Page_237'></span>Gaymer leaned forward and thrust his face within a
foot of Eric’s with an unspoken challenge to strike if he
dared.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And who under the sun are <em>you</em> to tell me what I may
do and what I <em>mayn’t</em>, what you’ll <em>let</em> me do?,” he asked.
“There are moments, my dear Lane, when you make me
impatient. <em>I</em> don’t butt into your private affairs—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“As I told you once before, Ivy’s a friend of mine,” Eric
answered, tipping his chair back.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And of mine. You were very much concerned to find
out whether we were engaged to be married; and, though
it’s no more your business now than it was then, I may tell
you that we are.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric shook his head slowly:</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’s been trying to cure you of that delusion for some
days. I understand you did once give her a promise, but
that was for your own ends. And I understand you’ve
offered it again, no doubt again for your own ends. But
when a girl’s been seduced and deserted and left with a
baby—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You damned liar!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gaymer jumped up and stood threateningly over Eric.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s no use getting abusive! Perhaps I ought to have
said that she was <em>going</em> to have a baby, but that now she
won’t. She may die, though; and, in that case, Gaymer,
nothing in heaven or earth is going to save you; I shall honour
you with my undivided attention. If she pulls through,
we shall not require to see or hear anything more of you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You damned liar!,” Gaymer repeated; but his voice had
fallen to a whisper, and Eric discovered with nicely blended
surprise and rage that the incredulity was unassumed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t go on saying that! These things do happen, you
know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But this is the first I’ve heard of it!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well... You know now. I saw Ivy for a moment
<span class='pageno' title='238' id='Page_238'></span>this afternoon, I saw what she was going through... You
vile little cad!... And I’ve seen her daily, I’ve seen what
she’s had to go through—mentally—for your pleasure and
amusement. The first you’ve heard of it, you swine! Of
course it is! Ivy has too much pluck and too much pride
to come and ask you to marry her out of charity. I
shouldn’t be telling you now, if she wasn’t lying at death’s
door—Yes, you beast, I’ve seen her—and if I didn’t know
it’d kill her to have you blustering in and bullying her...
That girl—I met her before you did, and she was as innocent
as a child—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hold on a bit!,” Gaymer interrupted.</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric was out of breath with the vehemence of his attack.
He leaned back panting, dizzy with excitement and hunger.
Gaymer was still standing over him, but no longer menacing;
he rocked a little, and his face was shapeless and
flabby. Once, at the onrush of an air-raid, Eric had seen
a drunken man lying helpless in the road; with the bursting
crash of the first maroons he had become sober, drawing
himself slowly upright, while the flush and fire of drink
faded out of his cheeks, leaving him tremulous, unmanned
but lucid. Gaymer was no less unmanned now.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think that’s all I need tell you,” Eric concluded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m not altogether there yet... I say, d’you feel inclined
to come round to my rooms for a drink—?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish you would.” The truculence which was second
self to Gaymer had left him. “You can call me what you
like... Look here, Lane, we’re both of us a bit on edge;
you say you’ve had nothing to eat... Come round and
take pot-luck with me. It doesn’t commit you to anything;
you can go on saying and thinking just whatever you like
about me. But I want to hear about Ivy. On my honour,
I never suspected... Did you mean what you said about
her being at death’s door?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='239' id='Page_239'></span>Eric forced back a passionate answer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The doctor says he’s going to pull her through,” he
said at length. “I don’t know much about these things.
I <em>saw</em> her... We shan’t do any good by discussing it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gaymer leaned down and picked up his cane.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Won’t you come round?,” he asked again. “I want to
hear the whole story. You mayn’t believe it, but I’m very
fond of Ivy....”</p>

<p class='c009'>Before he appreciated that he was yielding, Eric found
himself being helped to his feet and led towards Buckingham
Gate. Gaymer walked with an uncertain lurch,
bumping into him at rhythmic intervals and saying nothing
till they were seated on the divan in his smoking-room and
he was collecting himself to order dinner. No sooner was
his housekeeper out of the room than he poured himself
nearly half a tumbler of brandy and drank it in two practised
gulps.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s better,” he murmured.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ll find yourself laid out with D. T., if you go on
like that,” Eric commented.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wonder... I’ve got a head like wood and, ever since
I was wounded, I’ve needed the devil of a lot to keep me
going... But I can ride or run or shoot or swim with
any one you like to put up against me... Well, Lane,
it’s not much use my apologizing for anything I may have
said, because I’ve never felt particularly friendly towards
you from the first day we met, which is some years ago
now, and I always very strongly resented your butting in
where Ivy was concerned. I enjoyed riling you. But I do
at least see that you had better reason for butting in than
I thought. I honestly <em>didn’t</em> think... I wonder if you’d
mind telling me your version of the business from the beginning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Starting sketchily from his first meeting in New York,
Eric described his relations with Ivy from the night when
<span class='pageno' title='240' id='Page_240'></span>he found her walking home alone from the Vaudeville.
When he came to their Maidenhead expedition, he paused
long in search of a formula.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She admitted a little; the rest I managed to guess. I
said I’d see her through,” he told Gaymer.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a second pause, but Gaymer sat swinging the
empty tumbler between his knees and staring blankly into
the empty fire-place. Eric continued his story to the point
where Gaisford came into the library to explain what was
the matter with Ivy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s all,” he concluded.</p>

<p class='c009'>The housekeeper came in to announce dinner.</p>

<p class='c009'>“D’you like a wash?,” asked Gaymer. When they were
alone, he leaned his head against the mantelpiece, idly
kicking the fender with his heel. “You seem to have
jumped my claim,” he commented with a note of surprise in
his voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Would you say you had much claim to jump?,” asked
Eric tartly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>I</em> think so... Come in to dinner. I’ll give you my
version, and you can tell me what you think of it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>While there was a servant intermittently in the room,
Gaymer preferred to talk about his life before the war; and
it was not until the end of the meal that he began to speak
of Ivy. He was naturally so uncommunicative that Eric
had been on nodding terms with him for three years without
discovering more about him than that he had been
severely wounded in the first months of the war and relegated
to light duty ever since; it seemed to Gaymer unlikely
that any one should want to know more, and he
spoke as though anything that he said might afterwards be
used against him. By the end of dinner he had relaxed
his hold on unimportant scraps of autobiography, and Eric
was able to sketch in a background; Eton and King’s, a
father who had died and a mother who had remarried and
<span class='pageno' title='241' id='Page_241'></span>gone to live in Italy, a sister who had married and drifted
out of his life; two years of aimless and mildly dissolute
life in London, varied with motor-racing....</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’d always had rather a turn for mechanics and I used
to have a lot of fun taking out cars and motor-bikes for hill-climbing
and reliability tests,” said Gaymer, lighting one
more in a long succession of cigarettes. He had come into
the room smoking and smoked continuously, sending away
one dish after another and drinking brandy and water in
equal quantities. “You don’t get fat on that sort of thing,
though, so I went into a London agency and sold cars on
commission to everybody I knew. ’Made a good thing out
of it, too. Then I started flying—did you know Babs
Neave in the days when we swooped down on Salisbury
Plain and broke up the manoeuvres?... I perfected a
new aero engine and hoped to make a good thing out of
that. Then came the war... I was smashed up a few
months before we met; d’you remember, you were dining
with that pretentious prig, my aunt Margaret Poynter, at the
end of ’15? Barring one trip to America, when I met you
again, of course, I’ve been doing office work at the Air
Ministry ever since, rather wondering what to do next. My
old firm has been making lorries for the War Office these last
four years; they won’t have any cars to sell for eighteen
months and then they can sell without the help of an agent.
I waited till I was quite sure there was nothing for me in
the Air Force, then I pulled strings to get out and went to
Poynter for a job. He has all kinds of interests, and, if I
don’t mind going into exile at Rio, he’ll place me with the
Azores Line... Let’s have coffee in the other room;
then this old hag can clear away without disturbing us...
Lane, this is a delicate position for us. I must tell you again
that you seem to have jumped my claim.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And I must repeat that you’ve no claim for me to
<span class='pageno' title='242' id='Page_242'></span>jump. Tell me honestly: did you ever intend to marry
Ivy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gaymer poured out the coffee and rang irritably for
liqueur glasses. Then he offered Eric a cigar, pierced one
for himself and rolled it thoughtfully round and round in
his mouth. It was impossible to guess whether he was deciding
how much to tell or simply trying to arrange his
thoughts. Eric sat down at one end of the divan, wondering
why he had come there and what he could add to the
few brutal facts which he had thrown at Gaymer in the
Park. He would have fainted, if he had gone without food
any longer, but, apart from the dinner, he had achieved
nothing; there was nothing to achieve. He wondered how
Ivy was....</p>

<p class='c009'>“I—don’t—know,” drawled Gaymer at length, finishing
his brandy and throwing himself into a chair. Drink had
restored some of his assurance. He was no longer dazed,
no longer a suppliant, and, if he had not yet reverted to his
old attitude of detached, provocative superiority, he was
growing gradually more combative. “You see, when I first
met her, marriage was out of the question. Later on,
when I said I’d marry her, I was quite ready... if it ever
came to that. But I didn’t start out with that intention.
I liked her, and she liked me... England’s the only
country in the world where people think there’s anything
wrong or unusual... And, since the war, girls have altered
a good bit; they don’t see why they shouldn’t have a
good time. Ivy had a thundering good time, the best she’s
ever had in all her life. I got her away from her damned
old stick of a father, I took her out and shewed her round;
it was all quite innocent and harmless. Then some one
began to talk, and she cooled off a bit; people were wondering
whether we were engaged, she said. And bit by bit
after that she began to put a pistol to my head. She’d
evidently made up her mind to marry me; I wasn’t a marrying
<span class='pageno' title='243' id='Page_243'></span>man, I hadn’t the money, but I told her that <em>when</em>
things straightened themselves out... There’s no point
in being engaged unless you get some benefit from it...
Before she actually came here, I did say as a matter of
form that I’d marry her, but at the time I doubted whether
either of us would want to. You know how these arrangements
end—you have a good time for a month or two; and
then the thing begins to pall; and then, if you’re wise, you
kiss and say good-bye while you’re still friends—without
waiting for the usual dreary scenes and quarrels. After
we’d had two or three months of each other I didn’t think
she’d talk about marrying me any more; if she <em>had</em>—after
three months—, she’d have been different from the others,
and perhaps this might be the real thing, perhaps we <em>should</em>
both want to go on. In that case I should have to consider
ways and means... Even then, you see, I didn’t think
anything would come of it. Well, very soon after that she
brought the question up again, and we had a bit of a
bicker; <em>she</em> went away in a huff, and <em>I</em> waited for her to
come to her senses. The next thing was that she came to see
me that night—a month later,—and we had an up-and-a-downer.
She never said a word then; as I told you, I
never suspected till this evening. Well, I went on waiting
for her to come to her senses, but, when she cut all communications,
I saw I should have to take the first step. I
was missing her. Most infernally... So I got myself invited
to Croxton and I meant to find out what the trouble
was. If she wasn’t the girl I thought she was, if she’d
developed a conscience or been talked over or had decided
that it wasn’t workable to go on having a good time in the
old way, I’d made up my mind to marry her. That was the
first time I saw it definitely; she suited me very well, she
was a nice girl and very fond of me; it was rather a bore
getting married, but I was ready to do it. I tried to talk to
her down there, but she told me without any beating about the
<span class='pageno' title='244' id='Page_244'></span>bush that she’d had enough of me. I should have expected
to be a bit put out, but I only admired her for it. I didn’t
know she had it in her to hand me out my marching orders
<em>quite</em> like that. There wasn’t any opportunity of speaking
to her again down there, but I watched out for her this
morning and had a word; and, when I met you this evening,
I was coming down to have another word... I
never bother much about defending myself, but, if I didn’t
know till a couple of hours ago, you can’t very well blame
me. Now that I <em>do</em> know, I shall do the right thing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He poured himself a second glass of liqueur brandy
after his unusual effort of sustained articulation and waved
the decanter towards Eric.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s nothing for you to do except to keep out of the
way,” said Eric. “If Ivy dies,—well, we won’t consider
that. If she gets well, she doesn’t want any help or recognition
from you; there’ll be no consequences for you to
fear; she starts fresh, and you may believe her when she
tells you that she never wants to see you again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gaymer shook his head and smiled tolerantly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, but I don’t,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’s told me and she’s told you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t give her up quite as easily as that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m not going to let you persecute her.” Eric took out
his watch and got up from the divan. Gaymer was becoming
truculent again, and they could look for nothing but the
dreaded, unprofitable wrangle. “I came here at your request;
if there are any questions you like to ask—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How soon can I see Ivy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You can’t. She may not live through the night. If
she does, I’ll make it my business to keep you away from
her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you afraid?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of you?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='245' id='Page_245'></span>“Are you afraid to let me see her, afraid that she may
make up her mind for herself?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’d done that before you got your marching orders at
Croxton.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric turned his back and took a step towards the door,
but Gaymer only sank deeper into his chair, with one leg
thrown over the other and his finger-tips pressed together.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’d better look at facts, Lane. There was a time
within the last four months when she belonged to me, soul
and body; she may belong to me soul and body again.
<em>May...</em> If you try to keep me away—I say ‘try’, because
you won’t succeed—, it’s because you’re afraid. You
think you’re going to marry her; I’ll assume you do; I’ll
assume she’s in love with you, if you’ll admit that she
must have been tolerably in love with me not so long ago.
As between the two of us, if she’s going to find that she
prefers me, would you sooner she found it out before you
try to marry her or after you’re happily married?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’s decided already.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’s decided on false evidence. When I tell her that it
was only to-night—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You won’t have an opportunity of telling her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You haven’t much confidence in yourself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t see why we should either of us submit to being
bothered by you any more. If you’ve nothing more to
say, I’ll get back to her. I warn you very strongly—don’t
make any attempt to see her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gaymer looked at him in silence for a moment and then
drew himself slowly out of his chair and walked to the door.
Eric picked up his hat and left the flat with a short, murmured
“good-night.” As he hurried across St. James’
Park he tried to sort his ideas into order and to escape the
oppressive sense of uneasiness which Gaymer’s vague
menaces had brought to life again. The fellow could do
<span class='pageno' title='246' id='Page_246'></span>nothing—one said that again and again, to get the problem
in perspective and perhaps to rally one’s courage—; he
could not break down doors, Ivy would never consent to
speak to him, to read his letters... Yet, if he came and
haunted them when they were married....</p>

<p class='c009'>It was this eternal, insoluble question of the hold that a
man retained on the woman whom he had once possessed,
the hold of the faithless and the brutal on those whom they
betrayed and ill-treated, the hold which women confessed
and of which some men boasted. Gaymer had almost said
in words that, as Ivy had once fallen to him, in her great
first surrender, she would yield again when he demanded it
of her... Eric found himself leaning against a tree on
the Mall, idly watching the taxis which raced with a jar and
rattle towards Buckingham Palace. Here was a sex difference,
for women retained no such hold on their men.
And he had spent half of his life trying to understand and
systematize the psychology of women. If Gaymer fought
him for possession of Ivy, it was anybody’s victory.</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor was gone by the time that he reached his flat,
but the nurse reported that all was well and that her
patient was out of danger, almost out of pain. He telephoned
reassuringly to Lady Maitland and asked leave to
say good-night to Ivy. When he opened the door, her eyes
were closed, and he felt a hot wave of anger that he should
have submitted to threats from a cad who sat soaking himself
with brandy, that he should still be threatened....</p>

<p class='c009'>Ivy opened her eyes and beckoned to him, with a smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t look so worried, dearest!,” she whispered. “I
know I’m being a frightful nuisance to you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you better?,” he asked, kissing her hand, which was
dry and hot.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m all right—honestly. I only feel rather tired. I
won’t be a nuisance to you any more, though.” She
<span class='pageno' title='247' id='Page_247'></span>turned away with a jerk that set her short hair tossing.
“You can get rid of me now, Eric, if you want to.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If I want to? I thought I’d lost you to-day, Ivy. It
wasn’t a very pleasant feeling.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Would you really be sorry...?” She stretched out her
hand and caught his wrist. “Eric, be honest with me!
You can get rid of me now—Oh, that sounds so horribly
ungracious! But you know what I mean. Do you want
me, Eric, or were you just sacrificing yourself for me? Tell
me honestly. I can bear it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She turned her face to him again; and he saw that her
eyes were narrowed and her lips tightly shut, as though
she were nerving herself to be struck.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can I keep you, if I want you?,” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You know you can.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And is it love—or because you think you ought to?
That’s what I’ve been waiting to find out all these weary
weeks.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You needn’t have waited, my precious darling! <em>I</em>
knew that first day at Maidenhead.”</p>

<p class='c026'>“So when morning was come, he goes to them in a surly manner,
as before, and perceiving them to be very sore with the stripes
that he had given them the day before, he told them, that since
they were never like to come out of that place, their only way
would be, forthwith to make an end of themselves, either with
knife, halter, or poison: ‘For why,’ said he, ‘should you choose
life, seeing it is attended with so much bitterness?’”</p>
<div class='c024'><span class='sc'>John Bunyan</span>: “<span class='sc'>The Pilgrim’s Progress</span>.”</div>
<p class='c025'><span class='sc'>When</span> the nurse came to turn him out of the room, Eric
steadied himself and tried to walk into the library as though
nothing unusual had happened. Once there, with the
morning’s letters still unanswered and the evening’s unopened,
he could not decide what to do. Forgotten names,
from a dream-world that he had forsaken, assailed him with
clamorous insistence; his friends, of course, could not
realize that for days all his interest had been concentrated
on Ivy and Gaymer, with the judge and Gaisford and his
own dim family grouped in the middle distance. Absurd
urgency to secure his presence at the opera: “<cite>L’Heure
espagnole</cite>, <i>it’s being given for the first time</i>”; letters from
America, informing him that the writers, who would never
forget the pleasure of meeting him in New York, were on
their way to England... In three days their world was as
remote from him as Venusburg from the regenerate <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Tannhaüser</span>;
America was but a country in which he had thought
of finding a sanctuary for his wife. There was no need
now for him to take Ivy abroad; and for three weeks he had
worked and schemed in the expectation of going to America
in the autumn for six months or a year....</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='249' id='Page_249'></span>Readjustment....</p>

<p class='c009'>The telephone-bell rang, and a woman’s voice enquired
for him:</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s Lady John Carstairs speaking. I’m so sorry to hear
about poor Miss Maitland. Amy Loring told me at dinner.
How is she? I was wondering if there was anything I
could do. You’ve got all the doctors and nurses you want,
of course, but it must be such an upset for a bachelor
establishment. My husband wanted to know if you’d care
for a bed here; we can give you a little room where you’ll
be able to work undisturbed....”</p>

<p class='c009'>As he thanked her, Eric smiled wearily to himself at the
speed and thoroughness of Gaisford’s workings. In
twenty-four hours it would be known from one end of his
little London to the other that “Connie Maitland’s niece,
who was helping Eric Lane in the absence of his secretary,”
had collapsed unexpectedly with appendicitis. He assisted
the report on its way by cancelling two dinner invitations
and an engagement for the week-end; growing bold in
mendacity, he stereotyped the story, as he had told it to the
judge, and despatched it with a late bulletin to his mother.
By this time there was no harm in telling Lady Maitland
that she might come any day, provided that she did not try
to stay more than a moment.</p>

<p class='c009'>The swift-flying rumour of London dinner-tables was
sometimes an occasion for blessing. In three weeks’ time
Ivy could be moved; the news of their engagement would
flash from house to house; ‘romance,’ hard-worked and ill-used,
would be pressed into service as thought-saving
description until he might hope to be spared, even in the
echo of a whisper, hearing the name of Barbara Neave or of
John Gaymer. He was too tired to cope with the tumult
which their names conjured up; he tried to forget them....</p>

<p class='c009'>Yet even now Gaymer could not be left where he was.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i>There is one thing which I must add to our conversation
<span class='pageno' title='250' id='Page_250'></span>of this evening</i>,” Eric wrote. “<i>Ivy and I are definitely engaged
to be married. I write this in confidence, as the engagement
cannot be announced until I have been through
the formality of seeing her father. This I hope to do immediately.
You will probably agree that this is the most
definite answer to the question which you were proposing
to raise.</i>”</p>

<p class='c009'>He signed the letter and returned to the unexplored pile
in front of him. The invitations stretched far into the
summer, but for the future he must take Ivy into partnership
in dealing with them; there were the customary appeals
for money, opinions and advice, the usual requests for interviews,
articles and lectures; a long envelope contained
the draft of the will which he had instructed his solicitors to
make for safeguarding Ivy in the event of his dying suddenly.
The necessity had almost passed; but, as he read
through the provisions, he filled in her name and rang for
his two maids to come and witness his signature. From
investments alone they would have rather more than a
thousand a year, which was tolerable even in days of
swollen prices; in addition he could reasonably hope that
his plays would not all cease suddenly and at the same
moment to yield him any fees. His income, taken on an
average, was probably far bigger than Mr. Justice Maitland
enjoyed from salary and securities.</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric became absorbed in his calculations and worked at
them until he was too tired to see any more. Ivy and he
would have enough for a flat in London and a cottage in
the country; they could winter abroad and travel to their
hearts’ content; when children came, they could be given
the best upbringing and education, as befitted the beautiful,
dark-haired, grey-eyed children that Ivy would bear.
Hitherto he had never thought of himself as a father; and
he fell asleep with a new, delightful picture of Ivy holding
their first child in her arms, herself but a child still....</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='251' id='Page_251'></span>Next day a budget of sympathetic enquiries awaited
him, and he was kept busy with pen and telephone. There
were presents of flowers and fruit, offers of personal assistance,
general invitations and an embarrassing procession
of callers. Eric debated with himself whether to issue
orders that Captain Gaymer was not to be admitted; he
decided that, if his letter were not enough of a deterrent,
there would at least be no attempt at a forced entry for
some days.</p>

<p class='c009'>Though he kept reassuring himself, it was a shock to
receive a letter in the evening and to trace the straggling,
unfamiliar writing down to the signature “Yours sincerely
John Gaymer.” Eric felt his heart beating more quickly
as he turned to the opening words:</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i>I have your letter. All that you say may be true, but it
doesn’t affect my point. So far as I know, the facts have
never been put before Ivy. Will you tell her that I should
like to see her as soon as she’s well enough? The issue is
quite plain.</i>”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric locked the letter away in a despatch-box and walked
up and down the library, trying to compose himself before
Gaisford came in from the sick-room. Even without Gaymer,
the last few weeks had been sufficiently exhausting—first
Ivy, then Barbara and the succession of unnerving encounters
with her; and, before that, the shock of her marriage,
the torturing sense of betrayal, the endless nights
and days of inward raving and outward stoicism in which
he had travelled and lectured and written from end to end
of America like an effigy of himself with the spirit
torn out and bleeding apart; and, before that, the two years
of illness and madness. It was not surprising if he sometimes
felt that something in his head, just behind the eyes,
would snap; it was unpleasantly surprising to calculate that
he had not felt well for months, that he was half-consciously
waiting to hear the snap.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='252' id='Page_252'></span>He was sitting with his head bent forward, squeezing
his fists against his temples, when the doctor came in. The
door was open, and Eric never knew how long Gaisford
had stood watching him before he looked up; and, though
he rallied at once and asked steadily enough for the evening
report, he felt trapped.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’s doing very nicely,” said Gaisford, still looking at
him curiously. “If you don’t let people see her till I give
you leave—.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You can trust me for that,” Eric interrupted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And if I say you’re not to see her yourself?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shouldn’t dream of going near her against your
orders!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor silenced him with a grunt and began digging
like an industrious terrier among the papers on the writing
table.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell me where you keep your cigars and don’t become
theatrical,” he advised. “Since when have you started
this flattering regard for my orders?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve done everything you’ve told me to.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Since yesterday morning. In other days I used to prescribe
for you, I’ve even pulled you out of one or two
tight corners for which posterity is likely to be more grateful
to me than you are. Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Seniores
priores</span>.</i> <em>I’m doing</em> the talking. Well, you’ve always had
the sense and justice to admit that you wouldn’t have got
into eighty per cent. of those same tight corners, if you’d
followed my orders earlier. D’you remember the man in
Kipling who always prophesied trouble in the Balkans in
the spring? It was a fairly safe shot. I always seem to
prophesy a nervous breakdown in about a fortnight’s time
for you. Before you go to bed this night, I’m going to overhaul
you; and then you’re going away—not for my sake,
nor for yours, but for your young woman’s. You’re no
use to her, if you smash up; and you’re going to smash up,
<span class='pageno' title='253' id='Page_253'></span>unless you take in sail. What’s the trouble? I left a message
last night to say she was out of danger.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And, before that, you sent me off to have a nice, bright
dinner... I tumbled across that swine Gaymer, and you
may be amused to hear that we dined together. Gaymer had
never suspected anything till that moment; he appreciated
that there was a certain coolness and he was leaving her to
come to her senses! <em>Now....</em>”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric jumped up and shut the door, conscious that he was
scoring bad marks against himself by his restlessness but
hardly caring to keep up pretences any longer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well?” said Gaisford.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know... He swears he’s in love with her,
wants to marry her. And he’s made up his mind to see
her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<em>I</em> shall have something to say about that for the next
three weeks.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And by then the engagement will be announced. The
judge told me he was going away to-morrow, but as soon
as he comes back....”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s troubling you, then?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric continued to pace up and down between the windows
and the door, staring at the carpet, locking and unlocking
his fingers behind his back and trying to find words for the
new doubt which Ivy had not resolved even when she
promised herself to him the night before:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m not easy in my mind... I don’t know... Does
a woman <em>ever</em> break her first lover’s spell? I seem uncertain
of everything.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you’d better put it to the test. You’ll be a fool to
marry her, if you think she’ll come at the other man’s
whistle. I told you that—weeks ago, in this very room,
when we first discussed it. Let him see her, let her make up
her mind.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='254' id='Page_254'></span>“She’s <em>made</em> it up. If he comes, she’ll send him away
again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then she <em>has</em> broken the spell? I don’t know whether
I’m not following you very well....”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric laughed mirthlessly:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m not surprised. Sometimes, Gaisford, you get a feeling
which won’t bear analysis or definition or argument;
it’s just there... I left Gaymer yesterday in a state of
panic. I felt that he was the better man. He was doing
prodigies of valour in the war, while I was collecting rejection
papers; and I sometimes wonder whether women
care for anything but the best animal on the market. Fastidiousness
in conduct, super-culture, the ability to ‘see two
points in Hamlet’s soul unseized by the Germans yet’—all
that may appeal to some, but they’re atrophied women, without
sex. The war has made our scale of values very primitive...
When I was at school, I wasn’t allowed to play
games; and, if other people despised me in consequence,
you bet your life I despised myself more; I never had a
friend, in consequence, till I went up to Oxford... The
war was a fair test whether a man was a man—in courage,
physical endurance, ability to command and to obey, herd-capacity
to protect the female, the young, the home. Well,
I couldn’t survive that test. Better a live crock than a dead
hero, you may think, if you happen to be one of the crocks;
but, when I left Gaymer last night, when I stood leaning
against a tree in the Park picturing the pair of us as two
males fighting for one female, I said, ‘You drunken brute,
you’re the better man.’ And, if I feel that, a woman will
feel it, too... Ivy loves me; I’m quite sure of that. But
I’ve never imagined she felt any passion for me, you
wouldn’t expect it in her present state. Undoubtedly she
once felt passion for Gaymer... You want to know what’s
worrying me. Well, it’s just that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you’ve lost confidence in yourself so much that,
<span class='pageno' title='255' id='Page_255'></span>if the girl came to you every quarter of an hour, protesting
that she preferred you and didn’t want to see the other man,
you still wouldn’t believe her. Go away for a holiday, Eric.
If I agreed with your sex-generalizations about ‘better men’
and ‘finer animals’—I don’t; and I suspect you of taking
your psychology from novels by unmarried women—, I
should tell you you’re becoming relatively worse and worse
every day that you neglect your health. Go right away for a
few weeks.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t like leaving Ivy at Gaymer’s mercy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then agree with him that he may come and get his <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">congé</span></i>
from the girl’s own lips, if he’ll promise not to bother her
till she’s well again. Now I’m going home. And you’d better
cut off to bed and stop thinking about anything.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The next morning Eric drafted, copied and redrafted a
letter to Gaymer:</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i>I have not given your message to Ivy</i>,” he wrote finally,
“<i>because she is not well enough to be worried even with a
hint of such a thing. I should have thought that she had
made her meaning quite clear, but, if you need to be convinced
by hearing it again from her, I will suggest that she
disabuse your mind once and for all. Whether she will
see you or not I cannot say; and, if she refuse, I shall not
allow you to molest her. If she consent, it must be on one
condition; you must not attempt to see her or to communicate
with her for a month from now. If you tell me
that you agree, I will put this proposal before her.</i>”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no answer to the letter, but, as Eric left his
club the following night, he met Gaymer returning from
dinner with the Poynters in Belgrave Square. They so narrowly
avoided a collision that it was useless for either to
pretend that he had not seen the other. Both stopped short
and stood silent; then Eric said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hullo!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='256' id='Page_256'></span>Gaymer half put out his hand, withdrew it and put it out
again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hullo!,” he answered with unwonted apparent cordiality.
“You going my way?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m rather tired. I think I shall take the Tube to Dover
Street,” said Eric, reflecting rapidly that Gaymer could not
reach Buckingham Gate by that route without fetching a
wide compass.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Split the difference and walk with me as far as Lancaster
House,” Gaymer suggested. “I got your letter. I’ll
say at once that I accept the conditions. You’d probably
prefer to have it in writing—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s not necessary, is it?,” Eric interrupted quickly
and in embarrassment.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gaymer chuckled malevolently. He had hitherto spoken
seriously and with a touch of dignity, hiding any antagonism
that he might feel under an easy but disconcerting friendliness.
The dignity and restraint were shattered by the
chuckle.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You mean that, if I’m going to break my word,” he
said, “I shall break it just the same whether it was in writing
or not?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I meant that, if you gave me your word, I should
accept it without any bonds or witnesses.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Devilish good of you...” Gaymer paused and took
out his cigarette-case. “You talk just like your own plays.”
He paused again and fumbled with an automatic lighter.
“Babs Neave always used to say that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In his turn Eric paused and began to fill a pipe. They
had gone too far into the Green Park for him to branch off
and seek the Down Street station; he could not turn on his
heel and refuse to walk farther with the fellow; yet Gaymer
was steadily and progressively attacking him, first with common
rudeness, then with a sneer at his work, finally with a
depth-charge which he exploded to see what effect the name
<span class='pageno' title='257' id='Page_257'></span>of Barbara would produce. Gaymer had known much and
suspected all; he had been present, when Eric and Barbara
first met at dinner with Lady Poynter; he had speculated
with the rest of them and had once interrogated Barbara
about her “writer fellow” until she froze his jesting...
Intoxication might explain much, but it provided no motive
for the baiting unless Gaymer wanted the satisfaction of a
brawl which would contribute nothing to the problem of
Ivy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Even off the stage one accepts a man’s word, until he’s
proved that it’s unworthy of acceptance,” said Eric.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you’re satisfied with mine?,” asked Gaymer. “It’s
not so long since you thought I’d broken my word to
Ivy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He was still obviously exploring for a quarrel, but Eric
would not help him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s easier, if we confine ourselves to the future,” he said.
“You’ve given me your word and you can see Ivy—if she’ll
see you; I’ll ask her to—as soon as she’s well enough.
And you won’t try to get in touch with her till then, will
you? I shan’t do anything to prejudice you. As a matter
of fact, I’m going away for a few weeks, but, until the time
comes, I’ll promise not to queer your pitch, if you’ll promise
to wait till you’re sent for. Is that a bargain? After all,
it’s not to the interest of either of us to injure her health.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They had reached Lancaster House, and Eric held out his
hand. Gaymer hesitated for a moment and then gripped it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was only ragging you, Lane,” he said with an awkward
laugh. “Dining with Aunt Margaret fairly gets on my
nerves: she’s like a gramophone with all the newest and
most expensive “intellectual” records. Turn the handle,
put in a new needle; “The Psychoanalyst’s Ragtime Holiday,
as played by the Freud-Jung syncopated orchestra”...
Does she know <em>anything</em> about <em>anything</em>?... And that
fellow Poynter riles me. ’Told me to-night that my job
<span class='pageno' title='258' id='Page_258'></span>had fallen through and I was to be patient... He’s simply
not trying... I’ll keep the bargain—letter and spirit. In
the meantime you’re not announcing the engagement? I
can’t consent to that, you know; it prejudices my chances,
if Ivy has that to explain away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll wait till she’s seen you, if you like,” said Eric.
“Honestly, it won’t make any difference to you, but I want
to play fair. Good-night. One of us will write to you
soon.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The next day he broke the news to Ivy that he was going
to the country. Her face fell at the prospect of being left
alone, but the doctor came in before the discussion was over
and quenched the first smoke of opposition.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think I ought to tell you that I’ve seen something of
Gaymer the last few days,” Eric told her, when he came to
say good-bye. “He’s very anxious to see you. He didn’t
know you were ill, he didn’t suspect any reason why you
should be. I don’t quite know what he told you at Croxton,
but he assures me that he regards himself as being still
engaged to you. I reminded him that you’d already given
him his answer, but he persisted that there are new facts.
If you don’t want to see him—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t!,” Ivy cried in apprehension. “You must keep
him away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was an appeal for protection, but Eric could not protect
her against an attack which had not been launched. It
wrung his heart to see Ivy helpless and pleading, but he
was so tired that he would gladly have dropped into a trance
where responsibility and striving were unknown, where he
could rest, where no one could blame him or attack him or
appeal to him....</p>

<p class='c009'>“He won’t take it from me,” he pointed out—and was
hurt to see that Ivy was disappointed in him for the first
time. He wondered how Gaymer would have spoken and
acted, if the positions had been reversed....</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='259' id='Page_259'></span>“I can’t see him without you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My child, then don’t see him at all. When you feel well
enough, send him a line and tell him that nothing he could
ever say or do would make any difference.”</p>

<p class='c009'>When Eric reached Lashmar Mill-House, he found that
an inaccurate but serviceable legend had already been woven
round Ivy’s illness. For days and nights, he gathered, he
had been nursing her single-handed, which accounted for
a natural look of fatigue on his face; for the operation his
flat had been turned upside down, and he had now been
driven out to make way for a second nurse. It was an
explanation which barred all speculation about his own health
and absolved him from confessing that he was himself in
Gaisford’s hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you be able to have Ivy down here, when she’s fit
to move?,” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course,” Lady Lane answered warmly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’ll be convalescent in a fortnight or three weeks. I
was thinking of staying here in the meantime... The
country’s looking very beautiful. I think I shall go for a
stroll before dinner.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He walked through the house and crossed the mill-stream
into the woods by the plank-bridge over the wheel. Unless
he prompted her, his mother would patiently abstain from
asking him about Ivy; but there was an unspoken question
in her very silence, she was sharing his anxiety and his
hopes, waiting hungrily to be told that all was well. It was
curious that he felt so much less certain of Ivy since she
had promised to marry him. Gaymer was so sure of himself
that he must inevitably overpower her; people always
seemed to win if they were convinced that they would
win....</p>

<p class='c009'>And, conversely, no man ever won unless he believed in
himself. Eric pulled himself together physically, holding
his head up and walking boldly instead of shambling. He
<span class='pageno' title='260' id='Page_260'></span>believed in himself and he believed in Ivy. Unless a woman
were dead to honour and gratitude, he had nothing to
fear.</p>

<p class='c009'>A fallen tree trunk barred his path. He was glad to sit
down on it, because he was too tired to go on walking with
any pleasure, and his train of thought had incapacitated
him like a blow at the back of his knees. Barbara, who admitted
always that she loved him, even when it was too late,
had broken down at that test; he had confidently left everything
to her honour and gratitude... Women were not to
be trusted... But he trusted Ivy... Yet <em>should</em> he trust
her?</p>

<p class='c009'>The moment’s pause had not rested him, but he jumped
up because it was harder to brood when he was walking
quickly. Besides, this holiday had to be taken very seriously.
He had thought out a scheme which was to put him in hard
physical condition; a plunge into the mill-pool as soon as he
was called, a sensible breakfast instead of the jaded Londoner’s
tea and toast, a glance at his letters and the papers,
one pipe (and no more; no cigarettes, either), a line to
Ivy and then a good tramp, wet or fine, from ten till one,
a bath and change of clothes, luncheon, another pipe, a second
walk till tea or, perhaps, dinner, a third pipe and a book,
with bed at half-past ten. That, if anything, would keep
him from worrying and make him sleep. He looked at his
watch and almost decided to begin the treatment then and
there with six miles on the high-road before dinner. If he
elected to saunter on through the woods, it was because he
was really too tired to face the glare of the road and the
exertion of hard walking.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was easier to keep his resolution of going to bed early,
though he made an unpromising start next day. Instead of
the usual maid with letters and hot water, his mother came
in unexpectedly with breakfast on a tray.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You looked so tired last night that I thought I’d let you
<span class='pageno' title='261' id='Page_261'></span>have your sleep out,” she explained. “I waited till eleven
and then, thinking I heard signs of life—My dear boy, how
hot you are!” She put down the tray and laid her hand on
his chest. “Your pyjamas are wringing wet!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Too many bed-clothes, I expect,” answered Eric, as he
inspected the handwriting on his letters.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s only one blanket. And it wasn’t at all a hot
night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, but I can undertake to sweat away about two
pounds a night in mid-winter. I suppose it’s because I kick
about in bed so much.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you haven’t any flesh to spare. I wish you weren’t
so thin, Eric.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You mustn’t worry, mother. It’s beyond the wit of
man to make me fat.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lady Lane did not pursue the subject, but she continued
to look anxiously at him. To turn her thoughts, he handed
her a note from the nurse reporting that Dr. Gaisford was
wholly satisfied with Miss Maitland’s progress and would in
future not need to see her more than once a day.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That ought to make you happier, Eric,” said his mother.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It does. I don’t know what I should do, if I lost
Ivy...” His voice was graver than he had intended, and
he decided to go on and to fortify himself by taking his
mother into his confidence. “You remember the last time
we discussed her? You do like her, mother, don’t you?
You do—approve? As soon as she’s well enough, we’re
going to get everything fixed up. Don’t tell the guv’nor
yet, because you know he’s temperamentally incapable of
keeping a secret. But you are pleased, aren’t you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lady Lane bent down and kissed his forehead.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My blessed boy! It’s time you had a little happiness.
And it’s certainly time you had a wife to look after you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>What with his letters and the papers, which Sir Francis
brought up in person, Eric narrowly avoided being late for
<span class='pageno' title='262' id='Page_262'></span>luncheon; and his scheme of diet and exercise was again
postponed by his mother’s suggestion that he should come
out with her in the car. He salved his conscience in consenting
by the reflection that he would at least be in the
open air; when, however, Lady Lane suggested after tea
that he should lie down until dinner, he began to scent a
conspiracy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re looking so wretchedly tired and thin that I want
to keep you from working,” confessed his mother.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I’ll join the conspiracy,” said Eric.</p>

<p class='c009'>For a week he spent half the day in bed and the other
half motoring or walking in Lashmar Woods. If he failed
to put on any weight, at least he began to feel less tired.
The ghosts that lay in wait for him in London seemed to
have been driven away by the sunshine and scented wind
of the garden. Every day the nurse wrote that Ivy was
maintaining steady progress; he had two reassuring letters
from Gaisford and at last a pencilled note from Ivy herself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i>I’m almost well and longing to see you. Thank you for
all your divine letters. I’m counting the days till you come
here to fetch me away. Do thank your mother for asking
me—and for the flowers. I had a long letter from J. G. this
morning, explaining and arguing and asking when he might
come to see me. He said he’d been expecting to hear from
you and couldn’t make out why you’d not written. I told
him it was no good; in fact, I wrote just what I told you
I would.</i>”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric tried to remember whether he had received a specific
promise that Gaymer would not write; there had been some
phrase about “not communicating”... Gaymer may have
interpreted this to mean personal communication; or he
might be acting on the principle that wise men give promises
and fools accept them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ivy’s next letter narrowed the field of choice.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='263' id='Page_263'></span>“<i>J. G. has been here,” she began. “He called with some
flowers, and nurse let him in. Several other people had
been, so she never asked me. I said at once, ‘I can’t see
you;’ and I told him that I thought he’d promised you faithfully
not to come here. He said he only meant to come to
the door with the flowers, but that he couldn’t help coming
in. He wasn’t going to argue, he said, but he was responsible
for everything and he must come and ask me to
forgive him. I told him I’d forgive him, if that gave him
any pleasure, but he must understand that everything was
over. On the whole, I was rather glad to have it out with
him. He must see now, because at the end he said—horribly
bitterly—, ‘Your love is rather short-lived, Ivy.’ I refused
to be drawn. If he likes to think that, he may, I
don’t feel it’s worth having a row with him, Eric, about
coming, because we have cleared the air, however painful it
may have been at the time. And it isn’t pleasant, you know,
to have him thinking that I’m unfaithful to him. I did love
him—desperately; I’m even willing to believe now that he
always meant to behave honourably; but, as I told him, it
doesn’t really matter whether there’s any foundation for a
misunderstanding, what matters is the effect it has on one’s
mind. It was no use pretending I hadn’t utterly changed
towards him. He couldn’t see how I could love him once
and then stop loving him, when the reason why I’d ceased to
love him had been explained away. He’s tired me out, dear
Eric, and I don’t want to think about him.</i>”</p>

<p class='c009'>Her letter reached Lashmar by the evening post, and
Eric spent a sleepless night after reading it. At one moment
he decided to return by the first train to London and mount
guard over Ivy’s door; at another he shuffled and discarded
cryptic phrases for a warning telegram to Gaisford... It
was long after daybreak when he fell asleep without reaching
a decision; and, when his breakfast was brought in, he
<span class='pageno' title='264' id='Page_264'></span>was too tired to eat it or to read his letters or to begin getting
up.</p>

<p class='c009'>Only when Lady Lane asked leave to send for the doctor
did he rouse to interest.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your man here is such a hopeless idiot,” he exclaimed
impatiently. “I think I shall run up and see Gaisford. All
I want is a tonic, but he <em>does</em> know about me. I can’t stand
answering a string of questions from a stranger.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lady Lane forbore to oppose him in his new mood of
nervous irritability; she contented herself with making him
promise to come down the following day and asking whether
he would care for her to accompany him. Her obvious
anxiety jarred on nerves that were already raw.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m <em>really</em> all right, mother,” he answered querulously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear boy, you’re <em>not</em>! I <em>have</em> had some experience
of you, remember. You’re shockingly ill. You know I try
not to worry you, when you’re not feeling well, but you
frighten me, Eric, when you look like that. Isn’t there
something you haven’t told me? <em>Can’t</em> you tell me?...
People are commenting on it. After church on Sunday the
vicar wanted to know... So, you see, it isn’t just fancy.
I have a pretty handful in your father, as it is,—trying to
make him take care of himself. I can’t have <em>you</em> getting
ill... <em>Isn’t</em> there anything, Eric?”</p>

<p class='c009'>His mother had come nearer to breaking down than he
had ever seen; a vague stirring of masculine protectiveness
steadied Eric.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m feeling used up,” he answered wearily. “It may be
this hot spring... I think it’s the war... and the strain
of the last few weeks, the strain of the last two or three
years... It takes something to drive me into a doctor’s
arms, but I’ll get myself thoroughly overhauled by Gaisford
and, what’s more, I’ll tell you what he says and I’ll carry
out his orders to the letter. There’s no need for <em>you</em> to
worry, mother.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='265' id='Page_265'></span>He kissed her with a bluff attempt at reassurance and
scrambled out of bed. It was humiliating that he had to
steady himself by gripping the top of his dressing-table, and,
when he began to pour out his shaving-water, as much
slopped on to the wash-hand-stand as went into his glass.
He could only hope that, as she said nothing, his mother
had seen nothing.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was late afternoon when he reached Waterloo, and,
after dining at his club, he drove to Dr. Gaisford’s house in
Wimpole Street. The butler, who was a friend of many
years’ standing, regretted that his master was not yet returned
and invited Eric to come in and wait.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose you’ve no idea where he is or how long he’ll
be?,” asked Eric.</p>

<p class='c009'>The butler retired to the consulting-room and returned
with an engagement-pad.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He dined at home at half after seven, sir,” he announced.
“Then he was going to Sir Marcus Fordyce in Hay Hill,
then to Mrs. Grimthorpe in Upper Brook Street, then to
Colonel Somers in Half-Moon Street—and then to you, sir;
to your young lady, I should say. He said he’d be back not
later than twelve.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And it’s half-past nine now. I’ll go home and wait for
him. If I miss him, will you tell him, when he comes in,
that I called? And will you ring me up and let me know
when I can see him to-morrow? Say I’ve come up from the
country on purpose.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He reached Ryder Street in time to find the hall lit up and
a bowler hat and stick on the table. The whole flat was
sweet and heavy with the warm scent of flowers. They
symbolized Ivy, and he could fancy that he was already
married and returning to their home. It was a new, electrifying
emotion, the sublime epitome of all the moments when
he had waited of a morning to hear her ring. Latterly she
<span class='pageno' title='266' id='Page_266'></span>had been too much the patient; until that moment the flat
had not drawn its life from her.</p>

<p class='c009'>A murmur of voices reached him from the passage leading
to her bedroom; he wrote “Don’t go till you’ve seen me”
on the back of an envelope and dropped it into the hat;
then he picked up the evening paper and went into the library.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the end of one cigarette he threw away the paper and
looked sleepily at the clock, thanking Heaven that he was not
a doctor. At this rate Gaisford would not be home by midnight;
and he must have had a heavy day to be calling on patients
after dinner... The sleepiness dropped from Eric’s
brain as he remembered an early bulletin from the nurse,
telling him that for the future Dr. Gaisford saw no need to
come more than once a day. The most overworked doctor
would not be paying his first visit at a quarter-past ten at
night; this was the second visit, and Ivy had undergone
a relapse; or the third, the fourth... If Ivy were dying,
they would have sent for him... Telegrams took long....
But Lashmar Mill-House was on the telephone... Trunk-calls
took long, too... But he had not left home till after
five... Perhaps they had forgotten, perhaps they had
been too busy... But one could add “perhaps” to “perhaps”
like paper bows to the tail of a kite... This was the
discordant jangle of snapping nerves....</p>

<p class='c009'>He sat long enough to recover self-possession, then
strolled unconcernedly into the hall. The hat and stick
were still there, the note in the hat. He bent down to read
his own words and wondered why Gaisford, of all men, had
abandoned his traditional silk hat for a bowler... A
sporting bowler, too with flat brim. He was trying to remember
whether there were any races near London to explain
the unseemly hat and the doctor’s no less unseemly
hour for calling, when he noticed violet-ink initials over the
maker’s name.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='267' id='Page_267'></span>The doctor was Richard or Robert Gaisford, Eric could
not remember which; certainly not “J.” As he began to be
certain that “J. G.” could only stand for John Gaymer, Eric
told himself in an audible whisper that he had to be very
calm; if there were anything in the old, hysterical premonition
of a stand-up fight with Gaymer, it would take place
in less than five minutes.</p>

<p class='c009'>He inspected the hat carefully, as though it were filled
with clues and secrets, then replaced it on the table, withdrew
his note and walked quietly down the passage to Ivy’s
room. The door was ajar, and he could hear perhaps half
Gaymer’s words, when he dropped his voice, and everything,
when he raised it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you admit it, there’s nothing more to be said. D’you
like the prospect of being married for fifty years to one man
when you’re in love with another? Oh, it’s too late now,
you’ve admitted it. <em>I</em> never had any doubt. You’ve got to
get out of it; and the sooner the better... It’s no good
denying it, Ivy; we’ve gone through all that. Look me in
the eyes... Ivy, do as I tell you—<em>now</em>. You <em>have</em> to do
as I tell you. You’ve never loved him as you loved me.
Give me your hand. You don’t shiver when you touch <em>him</em>,
you don’t belong to <em>him</em>.... Kiss me, Ivy. I said, ‘Kiss
me, Ivy’.” There was a laugh of contemptuous affection.
“There!... So valiant we were! So independent—at a
distance! Kiss me again—on my lips... Did you think
I’d let you go so easily? Didn’t you know that, if I stood
at the back of the church when you were being married and
just said ‘Ivy, come here’...? <em>You</em> knew that, and <em>I</em> knew
that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric found himself sitting on a chair half-way down the
passage. Ivy was being bewitched; obviously he must not
allow her to be bullied like this... Somebody ought to
go in and stop it....</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve promised Eric,” she was saying quietly.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='268' id='Page_268'></span>“And d’you think I care about that? He can’t hold you
to your promise, if you don’t want to marry him. You love
<em>me</em>, Ivy. Say it again!”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no answer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say it again!,” repeated Gaymer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I....”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric could not hear the next whispered words, but they
seemed to satisfy Gaymer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say ‘I love you more than my life’,” went on the relentless
voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I love you more than my life.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say—‘I will marry you and no one else—’”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a pause and a sob.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Johnnie, don’t make me! It isn’t fair on him!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You can’t be fair to us both!,” Gaymer cried.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He’s been so wonderfully good to me. I should have
killed myself, if it hadn’t been for him. I <em>told</em> him I’d
marry him, I said he was the only person in the world I
cared for. He’s done everything for me! We should have
been married by now, but he wanted to give me time to be
quite sure—”</p>

<p class='c009'>She was interrupted by a harsh, triumphant laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well for him he did! And you <em>are</em> quite sure, Ivy!
I’m not going through all this again. ‘I will marry you and
no one else.’ Say it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will marry you and no one else... Johnnie, it’ll break
his heart! I <em>can’t</em> say it!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you have. Do you take it back?”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a long silence. Then Eric heard a low but
distinct “No.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The passage had not been noticeably hot before, but the
still air glared like the burning blast from an open furnace-door.
Eric found his face streaming with sweat; and the
wooden chair-back was slippery in his grasp. There seemed
to be a murmur of confused voices everywhere—in the
<span class='pageno' title='269' id='Page_269'></span>passage on either side of him, in the hall—preeminently in the
hall, where one murmur dominated the other murmurs, and
one voice dominated all.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was Gaisford’s voice, authoritative and ill-tempered,
reprimanding some one.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, my girl, but I said my patient was not to be left.
You go off duty when the other nurse comes on—and not
a moment before. You’ve left the patient entirely unattended?
‘Seemed all right’ be hanged! Your duty is to do
precisely what I tell you. When did you go out? Half an
hour! I don’t believe it! I don’t mind telling you that you
haven’t heard the last of this.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric came into the hall, as the nurse hurried away with a
scarlet face and the doctor pulled off his gloves and threw
them on to the table, still muttering angrily to himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hullo!,” he exclaimed. “I thought I’d sent you away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I came up this evening to consult you,” Eric answered.
His voice seemed small and remote, but the doctor found
nothing amiss with it. “I was feeling rather seedy and I
thought I’d ask you to overhaul me. If you’re not very
busy, we might get it over to-night, when you’ve finished
with Ivy. I—I’ve only just come in,” he added hastily. “I
went to your place first. I rather fancy that in the nurse’s
absence some one must have let Gaymer in. I think he’s
with Ivy now, though I haven’t been in to see yet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was all admirably calm. The doctor did not even look
at him; but his frown deepened, and he strode down the
passage with threatening footsteps. Eric was not conscious
of having followed; but he found himself on the threshold,
as the door was thrown open. Ivy and Gaymer had been
given time to prepare themselves; she was lying back with
half her face hidden in a bouquet of lilies of the valley,
while he stood with his hands on the back of a chair, as
though he were just leaving. Neither shewed surprise or
<span class='pageno' title='270' id='Page_270'></span>discomfiture at the doctor’s volcanic entry, but Ivy could
not repress a cry at sight of Eric.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, young man, you can take yourself off!,” Gaisford
snapped at Gaymer, jerking his thumb towards the
door.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a confusion of four voices speaking at once.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I just brought some flowers.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Eric!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A pretty time to call—exciting my patient, when she
ought to be asleep!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“H-how are you, Ivy? I came up for one night—only
decided at tea-time....”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric found himself face to face with Gaymer, who
nodded quickly as he walked to the door. He was as much
concerned as a man who finds that he has left himself too
little time to dress before dinner—as much and no more.
He seemed to be murmuring, “’Evening, Lane. No idea it
was so late. ’Couldn’t get round before. Glad to see she’s
so much better.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus far for the audience; he retreated in good order;
and in another moment there was a rattle as he picked up
his stick from the hall table. Eric found his jaw moving;
but he could say nothing, he did not even know what he
wanted to say. It was no use staring at the blank door-way,
he could not turn without facing Ivy... The authoritative
voice was speaking again, apparently addressing him; the
resonant words defined themselves into “If you’ll run away
now, I’ll come and have a word with you on my way out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric went to his bedroom and began to undress, because
it gave his hands occupation. They were trembling until
he could hardly undo the buttons of his waistcoat. He
looked at his reflection in the mirror and found himself a
little paler than usual; his forehead was still glistening with
the insufferable heat of the passage, but there should have
been something to shew that he had been blown to bits and
<span class='pageno' title='271' id='Page_271'></span>was held together by shreds of tattered skin. Lines that he
had learned as a boy at school....</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c021'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<i>So tight he kept his lips compressed,</i></div>
      <div class='line in3'><i>Scarce any blood came through.</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>You looked twice ere you saw his breast</i></div>
      <div class='line in3'><i>Was all but shot in two....</i>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>And why should he murmur them to the tune of ‘Wenceslaus’?...
Was he delirious?</p>

<p class='c009'>Gaisford had seen nothing amiss. If it were but possible
to carry off the interview without shewing him anything...
After all, Ivy and Gaymer had not betrayed
themselves. “<em>I will marry you and no one else.</em>” With lips
not yet still from her betrayal of him, she had made a show
of composure. And Gaymer, forsworn and a walking lie,
explained coolly that he had brought some flowers and could
not get round before. They would probably have been no
less composed if they knew that he was in the passage, listening
to every word. Did they know? Did they fancy that
he had come in with the doctor?</p>

<p class='c009'>Did they care?</p>

<p class='c009'>He could not begin to think about it all until his brain
was fit to work. Gaymer had lied, Ivy had betrayed him;
there was room here for anger, jealousy... He had lost
her, when she alone had come to make life worth living,
when she was the prize and symbol of his victory over
fate; room here for shaking his fists at Heaven and cursing
God. To curse God and die... But God was quite equal
to keeping him alive. Room here for thinking of the future
and going stark mad. But these were all parts of a whole too
big for him to envisage yet; that at least he could see....</p>

<p class='c009'>It was curious that force of habit should set him methodically
folding his clothes and winding his watch... Before
committing suicide a man nearly always shaved
<span class='pageno' title='272' id='Page_272'></span>himself, without pausing to wonder whether it was not rather
wasted labour....</p>

<p class='c009'>He put on a dressing-gown and lay on his bed. It was
curious that he and Ivy should be destined to spend this
night of all nights within twenty yards of each other.
Curious world... Barbara had once said something about
the fun that God was having with her... Curious how
the light seemed to burn through the back of the eyes into
the brain. Curious that one lacked the energy to stretch a
hand to the switch....</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric was still staring at the ceiling when Gaisford came
in. The doctor’s moment of ill-temper had passed; and
this was a pity, because he would be less preoccupied and
more observant.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, my son, and what’s the matter with you?,” he
asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve become so extraordinarily limp.” The voice was
slow but firm. “The longer I stayed at Lashmar, the limper
I got. I wasn’t trying to work, but I couldn’t even walk a
couple of miles. It occurred to me that a tonic, perhaps....”</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor grunted and fitted the ends of a stethoscope
into his ears. The ritual which followed was very familiar
to Eric; chest and back, long breath, ordinary breathing,
holding the breath, tapping... The stethoscope darted to
and fro, as though it were playing a game with some elusive
noise inside him; it finished with the heart and began chasing
the lungs into improbable corners under the collar-bone
and shoulder-blades, dodging back to the heart when it was
least expected.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lie down. A deep breath,” said Gaisford.</p>

<p class='c009'>This lying-down portended something serious; or perhaps
the doctor was not yet sure. They were always so
uncommunicative; you might have a tolerably wide experience
<span class='pageno' title='273' id='Page_273'></span>of these examinations and yet not know what they
were trying to find.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Anything the matter?,” Eric asked, as the stethoscope
was detached and pocketed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ve not much flesh on you,” said the doctor, feeling
his ribs. “Are you eating properly?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The usual amount. But you know I never <em>did</em> run to
fat.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you perspire much?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Like a pig. I gave my poor mother quite a shock when
she came in one morning and found me as if I’d just come
out of the mill-stream. I save pounds on Turkish baths.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gaisford nodded and put a number of questions which
Eric seemed to answer adequately. They did not appear
to lead anywhere, but some of them were new to his experience.
At the end, the stethoscope was produced again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Anything the matter?,” Eric repeated, for the doctor was
frowning. The examination, too, was unusually long.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, yes. It’s what I’ve feared ever since I’ve known
you. We’ve caught it in time, but you’ll have to be rather
careful. There are four of you, aren’t there? What are
your brothers and sisters like? You can put on that dressing-gown;
I don’t want you to catch cold.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric weighed the question as he slipped his arms into the
sleeves. God was enjoying himself....</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s come back to that,” he suggested. “What is it?
Heart?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s been a bit tired for years.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lungs, then?... I see. Well, I’m not a child, Gaisford.
How long do you give me? Six months? A year?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor changed his spectacles and tipped Eric’s
clothes from an arm-chair. He could be exasperatingly slow
when he liked; and he always liked to be slow, when his
patients shewed signs of becoming unnerved.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Forty, if you do what I tell you,” he announced at
<span class='pageno' title='274' id='Page_274'></span>length. “If you don’t, you’ll get rapidly worse. By the
way, it’s chiefly in books that a doctor says you’ve three
weeks and two days to live; science isn’t quite so exact as
that, and doctors aren’t such damned fools... No! I’ll tell
you. This might have come at any time, because you’ve
been on the delicate side ever since I’ve known you. Now
you’re a little bit touched. It’s a bore, but it’s nothing to be
frightened about. I shan’t let you live in this country, of
course, and I shall cut down your work; but that doesn’t
matter, because you’re indecently rich for your age. And
I can give you a choice of places to live in—California,
South Africa, the Riviera—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is in confidence, of course,” Eric interrupted.
“You’re not telling my people—or Ivy... or any one?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No. But I’ll tell <em>you</em> that, if you try to marry that child
in your present state, you’ll deserve to be pulled limb from
limb.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t propose to.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you’ll wait a couple of years....”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric was troubled to keep his brain, now suddenly alert,
back to the doctor’s deliberate pace. The immediate future
was clear....</p>

<p class='c009'>“How soon am I to start?,” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Get out of London as soon as possible.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And—about Ivy. When will she be well enough to be
told?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should tell her at once—to-morrow. She’ll see <em>something’s</em>
up; she wanted to know to-night why you’d suddenly
come back without warning... I find that as a rule it’s
best to tell people the truth, however much of a shock it may
be. We’re all of us equal to a certain number of shocks;
and it seldom becomes less of a shock by postponing it and
wrapping it in lies.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll tell her to-morrow,” said Eric. “Do you want to do
anything more with me?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='275' id='Page_275'></span>“I’m afraid there’s no doubt of it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then I may as well turn in.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric threw off the dressing-gown and put on his pyjamas.
The doctor, he knew, was watching him, but he was successfully
deliberate and composed. They shook hands and
said good-night without emotion or straining after heroics.
There was a half-heard phrase about “having another word
with” him in the morning. Eric lay for a few moments in
darkness, waiting to hear the doctor’s car drive away; there
was no sound, however, and he was asleep before he had
done speculating whether Gaisford had come on foot or
in a car....</p>

    <div>JOURNEY’S END</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>“Your distresses in your journey... are proper seasonings for
the greater fatigues and distresses, which you must expect in your
travels; and, if one had a mind to moralize, one might call them
the samples of the accidents, rubs, and difficulties, which everyone
meets with in his journey through life. In this journey, the understanding
is the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voiture</span></i> that must carry you through; and in proportion
as that is stronger or weaker, more or less in repair, your journey
will be better or worse; though, at best you will now and then find
some bad roads and some bad inns....</p>

<p class='c023'>“My long and frequent letters which I send you, in great doubt
of their success, put me in mind of certain papers which you have
very lately, and I formerly, sent up to kites, along the string, which
we call messengers; some of them the wind used to blow away,
others were torn by the string, and but few of them got up and stuck
to the kite....”</p>
<div class='c024'><span class='sc'>Lord Chesterfield to his son</span>.</div>
<p class='c025'>“<span class='sc'>Miss Maitland</span> asked me to say she would like to see you
as soon as you are ready.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric thanked the nurse and continued dressing. The
night of unresisting, helpless exhaustion had been tranquil
as death; he wondered whether Ivy had slept... Or had
she been rehearsing the speech in which she would tell him
that she could not marry him? Or would she say nothing,
waiting for him to tell her that he had been in the passage
outside her room while she threw him aside for Gaymer?...
It was significant that she asked to see him. An
easy conscience must have told her that he would have come
as soon as he was dressed....</p>

<p class='c009'>He went in to find her tired and nervously excited, but
she achieved an unembarrassed smile of welcome and asked
how he was.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='277' id='Page_277'></span>“I’ll return the c-compliment,” he said, wondering why he
stammered. “How are <em>you</em>, Ivy? You’re the invalid.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I’m much better. I shall be able to come down to
Lashmar at the end of next week.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric turned away and looked for a chair. At times of
great mental exhaustion it was hard to tell whether a thing
had happened or whether he had dreamed it. Ivy was talking
as though she had never perjured herself for Gaymer,
as though she had never seen him again—an absurd, intoxicating
child with short black curls and thin white arms,
the immature bud of a woman... Yet there was a table
by the bed within reach of her hand; on the table stood a
black Wedgwood bowl; in the bowl a nodding mass of
lilies. Once or twice before, when she was living with Lady
Maitland and dining alone with Gaymer, she had confessed
to inventing fellow-guests to keep her in countenance and to
placate her aunt; she had regarded the lie as amusing and
clever, certainly venial; Eric hoped that she was not going to
lie now. Perhaps he had imagined that nightmare moment
in the passage, perhaps the sight of her frank grey eyes
kept his habit of love unbroken; undoubtedly he loved her
still, loved her so desperately that he could not bear to see
her made vile with a lie... But the lilies at least were not
imaginary... Her easy reference to Lashmar shewed that
she intended to confess nothing; she would leave him to find
out. One day he would receive a letter to say that she had
run off with Gaymer; in the meantime she played her double
part with outward unconcern, as though she were already
married and had a secret lover....</p>

<p class='c009'>“At the end of next week,” he repeated.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was easier to echo her words than to break new ground.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you going back at once? I hope you’re going to
stay here,” she said, beckoning him to a chair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I promised my mother to go back to-day.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='278' id='Page_278'></span>“Can’t you telephone? I <em>do</em> so want you to stay...
Eric, does your mother know? I’ve been so afraid she
might disapprove of me. Have you told her?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He shivered unconsciously; the appealing pose of fidelity
was cynical enough, without her becoming inartistic by
overdoing it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I gave her a very fair idea of what was in the wind,”
he said. “She’s very fond of you, Ivy. There’d be no difficulty
in that quarter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You haven’t seen father yet? When are you going to?”</p>

<p class='c009'>For a moment Eric was so much disgusted to find himself
participating in this game of make-believe that he did
not realize she was asking him a question and waiting for
an answer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know,” he answered at length. “I don’t know
whether I <em>shall</em> see him. There are certain rather considerable
difficulties... Ivy, d’you <em>want</em> me to go to him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>As he spoke, he was conscious that his tone had hardened;
there was a challenge and a warning in it. He waited to see
whether she would go on lying; the hint of menace must
shew her that she was underestimating his knowledge.</p>

<p class='c009'>A slight frown, a slighter shrug were her only signs of
emotion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I never <em>did</em> want you to go,” she answered. “My father
is nothing in my life now. I should actually have asked you
not to if you hadn’t frightened me by saying that he might
make trouble because I wasn’t of age.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric nodded and prepared a question which would leave
no room for evasion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ve thought it over carefully, I hope?,” he said.
“You still want to marry me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She held out her hands to him, but he pretended not to
see them. The last man to kiss her was Gaymer; where he
kissed, a fume of liquor and lasciviousness remained....</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='279' id='Page_279'></span>“You want to marry me after seeing—him? You’ve
satisfied him that it’s all over?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Her frown deepened, but there was no indication of embarrassment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He still claims that we’re engaged—,” she began.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Does he still think he’s going to marry you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ve told him you won’t?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He regretted the question as soon as it was uttered.
However dishonourably Ivy had behaved, there was no pleasure
in driving her inch by inch into a trap; in a world of
liars there was never much satisfaction in convicting any one
of a lie.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I told him that,” she answered. “I also told him I
would... You won’t understand that, I expect, but I
couldn’t help myself. That’s why I don’t want you to go
away and leave me, Eric; that’s why, a month ago, I didn’t
want to wait. I daresay you despise me, but I always feel
he can make me do whatever he wants. I can’t tell you why.
That night... when we came out of a theatre, he said
‘Are you going home, or are you coming home with me?’
I’d never been home with him so late, I knew what would
happen, I didn’t want it to happen. I was horribly frightened
and I hoped, when he saw I was frightened, that he
would spare me. I should have thought any man would...
I couldn’t help myself; and that’s why I’ve never been as
much ashamed as I ought to be. Even when I thought he’d
got tired of me, when I hated him and could have murdered
him, I still felt that he might come back and I should have
to obey him... I don’t want to be left alone, Eric. When
we’re married, it will be all right; I shall have you to protect
me. I’ve been ill—and, before that, I was desperately
miserable; perhaps I haven’t really been accountable for my
actions. But, if he’d picked me up in his arms last night
<span class='pageno' title='280' id='Page_280'></span>and carried me off, I couldn’t have resisted. Until we’re
married, you mustn’t leave me—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And, <em>when</em> we’re married, will it be easier to resist him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He’ll leave me alone. He may go abroad... <em>Do</em> you
understand? Or do you just despise me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She smiled wistfully and held out her hands to him again.
Though he had not kissed her on coming into the room, she
had not commented on the omission; perhaps she had not
noticed it. Their relationship had been wholly passionless.
When he brought her back from Maidenhead and saw her
for the first time in ecstasy, the glory in her eyes was spiritual;
it was gratitude, admiration, love and a great amazement;
if she then begged him to kiss her, it was because a
kiss was her readiest symbol of love. For Gaymer she had
once felt passion; when he ordered her to kiss him, knowing
the degree and source of his power, she obeyed. That would
pass in a few months; the strength of sex was only equalled
by its transience; and they would find nothing to put in its
place. While it was there, it was all-powerful; she could
only escape it by running away, by surrounding herself with
a bodyguard, by reminding the flesh that she owned claims
of the spirit also. In so far as Eric could analyse her mind,
she yearned to be with Gaymer; and she resisted the yearning,
because she owed a spiritual debt to some one else. She
would be happier with Gaymer—for a time; no doubt she
fancied that she would always be happier. But she was
prepared to sacrifice that for honour, for gratitude....</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m trying to understand,” he answered. “<em>I</em> once
thought that I was utterly helpless in one woman’s hands.
There was nothing I wouldn’t do... But I found it was a
thing one could overcome. If I went up in blue smoke here
and now, you’d marry Gaymer? You remember there was
a time when you wouldn’t look at him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t know everything then.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And, if I <em>don’t</em> go up in blue smoke and if he <em>got</em> enough
<span class='pageno' title='281' id='Page_281'></span>money, if we stood side by side before you, and you had a
perfectly free choice?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ivy laughed with a dove’s coo of devotion:</p>

<p class='c009'>“My darling, I should choose you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And if Gaymer tried to entice you away?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you wouldn’t let me go!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric shook his head sadly:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Aren’t you strong enough to stand by yourself without
wanting a man always to dominate you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The conversation was tiring her, and her voice became
faintly petulant:</p>

<p class='c009'>“When you’re lying in bed like this, all your will-power
goes. And I couldn’t sleep last night. I kept thinking of
Johnnie, I was frightened. You oughtn’t to have left me,
Eric. Everything would have been all right, if you’d
stayed here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gaisford thought I wanted a change,” he reminded her.
“And I’m afraid I shall have to leave you again. He wants
me to go abroad.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Eric, why? Are you ill?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Her eyes were filled with concern; he wondered how much
came from sympathy with him and how much from fear for
herself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Apparently I am. He wants to rest me and fatten me
up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But how long will you be away?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A couple of years, I should think.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ivy drew herself upright in bed and stared at him, with
parted lips:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Eric, you must explain!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s nothing much <em>to</em> explain. It’s out of the question
for me to marry at present...” He hesitated and looked
away. “It’s not fair to ask you to wait two years.”</p>

<p class='c009'>For a moment she did not answer. Then she cried:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course I’ll wait! You know that!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='282' id='Page_282'></span>It was easier to keep his eyes on the ground than to meet
hers. The valiant words were inevitable—at such a time and
in such an atmosphere; the moment’s hesitation was not.
And that, more than anything that she had said or hinted,
cleared his mind of doubt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, we won’t talk about it any more at present,” he
suggested. “Gaisford’s going to examine me again, and then
we shall know rather better where we are. Don’t worry,
Ivy. I’ve no intention of dying yet awhile. I only heard
about it last night, so I haven’t had time to think much about
the future.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In the afternoon Eric returned to Wimpole Street for the
further examination. The second report was fuller, but not
materially different: one lung was affected, and with reasonable
care he would be cured in a year or eighteen months.
He again begged the doctor to say nothing at present to his
parents or Ivy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s a lot to take into consideration,” he explained
vaguely.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m sorry about this business, Eric,” said Gaisford.
“But I’m telling you the truth. If you’ll be patient—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Everything will come right. <em>I</em> see... D’you think
your man would like to send a message to Lashmar to say I
shan’t be down to-night?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He walked into Oxford Street and through Hyde Park
to Piccadilly. Once before, after bidding Barbara good-bye,
he had bade good-bye to London, wandering from his flat to
the theatre, from the theatre to, his club, almost pinching himself
in the effort to remember that he was seeing them all
for the last time. One could never reproduce an emotion in
its first breathless perfection; though he went through the
same emotions, the earlier shock had numbed him protectively
against any that might come later. And, as it
proved, it was not the last time. In another two years he
might return to find Ivy married to Gaymer, as he had found
<span class='pageno' title='283' id='Page_283'></span>Barbara married to George Oakleigh; he would be two years
older, twenty years more disillusionized, with a bitter heart
for women and a dread of the blank emptiness before him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ivy was not to blame for meeting a force too strong for
her; she was ready to risk everything, even what she fancied
to be her own happiness, for loyalty and the honourable observance
of her promise. If he felt sore, it was because he
had come to love her; she had made him forget Barbara and
had given him the hope of a new life. But throughout, from
the first night when he discussed her with Gaisford, he had
made her his spiritual anaesthetic; while there was an opportunity
of offering her himself, his money and reputation,
his devotion and care, he had looked with the eyes of a
fanatic on this single act of sacrifice which was to give value
and meaning to his life. In trying to face the future, it was
the meaninglessness of life that appalled him....</p>

<p class='c009'>He had been trying, ever since their talk in the morning,
to banish himself in imagination to California and to consider
what was best for her. Gaymer would ruin her life; he
would be unfaithful after six months and brutal after a year.
And she knew it. Should she be saved from that? Was it
ever worth trying to save man or woman from the woman or
man that they desired? Yet it was a poor proof of love to
stand aside and let her go to certain misery. If he mounted
guard over her, he could still keep her from Gaymer....</p>

<p class='c009'>And from her phantom of happiness.</p>

<p class='c009'>He turned into the Green Park and walked in the shade of
the trees towards Lancaster House. A woman bowed to
him; he returned the bow without seeing who she was, but
there was a scrape of gravel under her heel as she stopped,
and he heard his name called.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I <em>thought</em> it was you, but you had your chin so much on
your chest... Thinking out a new play?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mrs. O’Rane? I hope you didn’t think I was trying to
<span class='pageno' title='284' id='Page_284'></span>cut you! No, I hardly know what I <em>was</em> thinking about.
How’s your husband?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you go on for about a hundred yards, you’ll find him.
I have to rush off to a committee. Good-bye!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He shaded his eyes and looked down the pathway until
he saw a Saint Bernard asleep with his head on his paws and
the paws pressed in gentle protection against the feet of his
master. Eric walked on and greeted O’Rane.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s—wait a bit! that’s Eric Lane’s voice. Am I
right?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“First shot. You’re marvellous, Raney.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s patience, you know. And I’ve been thinking about
you a lot lately. How’s the patient? Lady John Carstairs
told me of your troubles. I wanted you to come and have
a shake-down with us, but she said you preferred to stay
where you were. I hear the operation went off all right.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes. She’s out of danger, I’m glad to say.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So Gaymer told me. It all happened within a few hours
of our coming up from Croxton, apparently.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric wondered when and why O’Rane had been talking to
Gaymer, but his speculation was cut short by a question:</p>

<p class='c009'>“By the way, is it true...? I heard an interesting piece
of news about you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I heard you were engaged.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now where did you hear that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric’s laugh seemed to ring shrilly, but O’Rane did not
notice it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell me first if it’s true,” he said. “I’m the soul of
discretion.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He held out his hand, smiling and eager to congratulate.
Eric hesitated and again laughed nervously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That ought to be an easy enough question for me to
answer,” he said, “but, as a matter of fact, I can’t.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='285' id='Page_285'></span>The neglected hand reached out and felt for Eric’s arm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I nearly came round to see you,” said O’Rane gently,
“but I thought you’d wonder what business it was of mine.
You remember our talk on board the <cite>Lithuania</cite>... I know
a good deal about you, and we’re very old friends... So I
was glad, more than glad, when I heard you were actually
engaged. Then I heard—”</p>

<p class='c009'>His fingers slacked their grip on Eric’s arm; and his voice
died away.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That I <em>wasn’t</em>,” Eric suggested.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, no. I heard—at least, I gathered that it wouldn’t
be all plain sailing. I gathered it from Gaymer himself.
D’you remember at Croxton that I said I thought I should
have to take him in hand? He was drinking too much, he
wanted pulling up. He’s been living in my pocket the last
day or two. I can make something of him. But I’m afraid
his interests cuts across yours.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Would it bore you to hear the whole story?,” Eric
asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a welcoming nod of encouragement. Eric
tried to speak dispassionately, though he knew that he was
appealing for sympathy and help; and the appeal grew
stronger as he saw his companion’s expression becoming
more grave.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Confidence for confidence,” said O’Rane, when he had
done. “Quite soon after I married, there came a time when
it seemed possible that Sonia and I had made a mistake, a
time when I felt that, if I wanted her to be happy, I should
have to say, ‘Think this over carefully; you’ve only one life
and, if you believe you’ll make more of a success of it with
another man, you know I’ll not stop you’... I said that,
Eric, and I’ve always felt it was the right thing to do. I
won’t pretend it was easy, but the right thing seldom is.
As it happens, everything’s turned out well... I believe
it’s a question that a great many men ought to put to their
<span class='pageno' title='286' id='Page_286'></span>wives, instead of exercising harem-rights over a human
creature, made in God’s image, that they’ve bought or attached
to themselves. Do you want to love a woman or to
enjoy a slave?... I tell you this, because you must give
that girl the opportunity of slipping out of your grasp—”</p>

<p class='c009'>He stopped at the touch of a hand laid deprecatingly on
his knee.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t keep her, if she wants to go,” said Eric.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed you can. Use your imagination, man! After
all you’ve done for her, with the knowledge that you’re ill—Put
it on the lowest ground; she wouldn’t dare to have it
said of her that she’d thrown over a man with consumption
because she couldn’t wait two years for him to get well.
Probably you agree with me that a man who is a man doesn’t
make capital out of his physical infirmities. You must persuade
her that she’s under no obligation to you; and, if the
decision goes against you, you must accept it with a good
grace. You behaved well in coming to her rescue; you may
have an opportunity of behaving even better in giving up all
claim on her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric sat for some moments digging at the gravel with his
stick. Then he touched O’Rane’s arm and stood up.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s move on,” he suggested. “It’s—it’s hot here...
Raney, I’m not going to give her up. I don’t see why I
should.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope you won’t have to.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No one can compel me, if she says she’ll wait.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No one would need to compel you. Dear man, your devotion
to her is a very beautiful thing, it’s a thing you’ve
better reason to be proud of than anything you’ve ever done.
You wouldn’t degrade a devotion like that by keeping her
against her will.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric said nothing for several moments, but he laughed to
himself, and O’Rane gripped his arm as though the sneer in
the laugh stung him.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='287' id='Page_287'></span>“And I wonder what you think would be left for me, if I
did give her up!” he resumed. “It’s no good trying to make
me live in too rarified air. All this business about ‘the right
thing’—I’m not cut out for Cyrano de Bergerac or for Sidney
Carton; a good conscience, a glow of magnanimity—it does
me no sort of good, Raney. I know what I want, I know
how badly I want it. I can imagine pretty clearly what the
next two years are going to be like—vegetating on a verandah
in Arizona. She’s all I have left... But if there’s
nothing to come back to... I’m the one that has to go
through this and I want you to tell me what’s left.”</p>

<p class='c009'>O’Rane laughed and linked arms with him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll change lungs, if you’ll change eyes,” he murmured.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m sorry! My outlook’s a bit jaundiced. I expected too
much of life, I’d had a pretty fair hammering in one way or
another and I thought it was going to change, to end.”</p>

<p class='c009'>O’Rane stopped short and sighed with whimsical regret.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Like your novels and plays,” he suggested. “Life differs
from romance in that there are no happy endings. And,
when you’ve learned that lesson, you must learn that life
has no endings of any kind short of death. We try to divide
our lives into dramatic phases, but you know that there’s no
finality about your first disappointment in love; it modifies
the texture of your spirit and prepares you for something
else just when the dramatist scrawls his ‘Curtain’ and the
novelist writes ‘The End.’ Perhaps it prepares you for
another and a different love, perhaps for marriage: no one
but a fool would stop his play or novel with the clash of
wedding-bells. It’s not the end of anything except one stage
of an endless development; it’s not the beginning of anything
except the next stage of development. These dramatic and
literary forms destroy our sense of continuity. Hundreds of
generations have gone to the preparation of your personality;
you will enrich it in a thousand ways and hand it on by blood
or teaching or example to thousands of generations unborn.
<span class='pageno' title='288' id='Page_288'></span>You ask what is left... I should answer: your personality,
your ego. You have that left to build up, fortify, perfect.
I don’t say that the next two years will be particularly happy,
but you can come out of them a deeper, broader, bigger
man... You’ll give this girl her chance?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric walked on without answering. They left the Park
and passed along Cleveland Row to St. James’ Street. The
wind was blowing from the river, and they paused to hear
Big Ben strike.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Seven o’clock. I’d no idea we’d been talking so long,”
said O’Rane. “My wife’s dining out and going to the ballet.
I suppose you wouldn’t care to take pot-luck with me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should love it, when I’ve been home. Ivy’ll be wondering
what’s happened to me. Raney, what would you do in
my place, if you felt certain that, by giving a woman up,
you’d be sentencing her to utter misery?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To begin with, no one can ever be certain of that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gaymer’s a brute and a cad and a drunkard,” said Eric
hotly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He’s given up drinking for good. As for the rest, when
you see so many estimable men turning into brutes and cads
on marriage, it’s not unreasonable to hope that a brute and
cad may be converted by marriage into something better.
As a matter of fact, Gaymer’s neither. I saw him when, to
use his own phrase, he thought you’d jumped his claim; it
was the time when the girl’s life was in danger. Gaymer’s
very fond of her, too, though he’s English enough to hide it
from everybody but a man who has ears even if he’s no
eyes... Gaymer’s no fool. He knows that all his nervous
organism has gone to pieces in the war, he recognizes that
he’s left the rails and that, if he doesn’t pull up, he’ll go downhill
with a run. He wants some one to keep him steady; and
this girl—the only living creature in the world that he cares
for—is the only one who can do it. He’s fighting for her,
because she’s his one anchor. He can’t afford to lose her.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='289' id='Page_289'></span>“I can’t afford to lose her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps you mayn’t. I only want her to have a free
choice.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Freedom to marry a blackguard? He <em>is</em> a blackguard,
Raney, to have taken advantage of a girl’s youth and ignorance.
He’s a blackguard right through to the end! He
solemnly promised me not to go near her and then bursts
in the moment my back’s turned. He’s a libertine, a liar—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s no objection in a woman’s eyes. Every corespondent
is all that and perhaps a good deal more.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m not going to give her up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They turned into Ryder Street and walked up the stairs
to Eric’s flat. O’Rane waited in the hall while Eric went
into Ivy’s bedroom. She was sitting up, writing on her
knees, and, as he came in, she laid down her pencil and
handed him the letter. Her eyelids flickered, and he could
see that she spoke with an effort.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s to Johnnie,” she explained. “He called immediately
after you’d gone, but I told the nurse to say I couldn’t see
him. He’s just sent me a note... What did the doctor
say, Eric?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He didn’t add much to what he told me last night. Do
you want me to read this, Ivy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think you’d better. I told Johnnie that I didn’t know
what I was saying last night, when I promised to marry him.
I’ve begged him not to worry me—”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric fingered the letter without reading it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If I told you that the doctor didn’t know if I could marry
even in two years, what would you say?,” he propounded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Even!...? What do you mean? Did he say that?
Eric, tell me! You frighten me when you won’t say what’s
the matter with you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He pulled a chair to the side of the bed and sat down,
holding her hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t tell you anything very definite,” he answered.
<span class='pageno' title='290' id='Page_290'></span>“But I’m trying to look at all possibilities. I feel responsible
for you, Ivy. I want to think what’s the best for you. If
Gaisford says I must never marry, what will you do?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She looked at him with frightened eyes, and he saw that
her lips were trembling. Two slow tears rolled down her
cheeks and splashed on to his hand. So she had cried once
at the opera, and her tears had melted him. Now they
seemed to eat into his hand like acid.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shan’t die, if I can help it, Ivy,” he added. “If I did,
or if I couldn’t marry you, what would you do? Would you
marry Gaymer?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Eric, don’t be cruel! Are you doing this just to
frighten me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No! I’m thinking of your future. If you married him,
do you feel that you’d both be happy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should never be happy, if anything happened to you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Darling Ivy, leave me out for a minute! Imagine you’d
never met me. Do you feel that you’d be happy with him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If I’d never met you?... But, Eric—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You really love him, Ivy? Do you love him more than
me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t torture me! I could never love any one as I love
you. Johnnie’s quite different; I <em>feel</em> quite differently about
him... Eric, it isn’t kind not to tell me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She drew her hand back and leaned forward, throwing
her arms round his neck. He kissed her forehead and dried
the tear-rivulets on her cheeks. Then he unlocked her
fingers and stood up, turning half away.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll tell you, Ivy,” he said. “I asked you this morning
whether you’d wait two years—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will! You know I will!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know you will! Bless you! But two years are no
good. I hope to be very much better by then, but I shall
never be well enough to marry... Gaisford t-told me so
this afternoon,” he added with deliberation.</p>

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>When</span> Eric came back to the hall, he was startled to find
O’Rane still sitting there.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’d entirely forgotten about you,” he exclaimed. “Have
I been a frightful time? You must forgive me. I’m becoming
appallingly absent-minded.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You haven’t been very long,” answered O’Rane; then he
added inconsequently, “I was beginning to fear she might not
be so well.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A bit unstrung. I just want to scribble a note to Gaisford;
then I shall be ready for dinner.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He hurried into the library, tripped over an unseen obstacle
and had almost overbalanced before he discovered that
the lights were not turned on.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i>I have told Ivy that you say I shall never be well enough
<span class='pageno' title='292' id='Page_292'></span>to marry,</i>” he wrote. “<i>This may surprise you, but you must
back me up. I’m going away as soon as I can get packed and
tidied up; I shall be away for at least your two years. I want
you to tell people that it’s not serious, but I also want you to
convince Ivy that it’s all over. I’ll give you the whole story
if you want it; perhaps it’s enough for the present to say
that I want above all things to give her a free hand. After
all, if she’s still unmarried in two years’ time and if I’m a
whole man by then, we can revise our decision. She’s too
young to be tied for two years. You might burn this letter
and keep the contents to yourself.</i>”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ivy had been crying as though her heart would break; and
Eric had only left her room because his presence seemed to
excite her to fresh outbursts, and she was reacting on him.
While he wrote his letter, the long-drawn breathless sobs
seemed to fill the library—as they had filled it once before on
the night when he debated with Gaisford whether he should
come to her rescue—; it was imagination, of course, but he
wanted to get away as soon as possible, as far as possible.
And assuredly there must be no question of seeing her
again....</p>

<p class='c009'>He walked to the door and clutched at the handle as he
listened. The sobbing continued, and he wondered how long
he would have to hear it. It was almost too clear to be
imaginary; O’Rane must be hearing it, too... So might a
man go on hearing that one accusing sound until he went
mad. He filled his lungs and walked erect into the hall.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m ready now,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>O’Rane felt for his hat and stood up.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You think it’s all right to leave her?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why not? The nurse is somewhere about.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She seems—rather upset.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The crying was real, then, and some one else could hear
it. O’Rane spoke caustically, as though <em>he</em> were responsible....</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='293' id='Page_293'></span>“I’m afraid I shall only make her worse... Shall we
start? I’ll give you a hand, if I may; the stairs are rather
tricky. Are we going to your place, or will you come with
me to the club? I don’t want to meet a lot of people. You
said we should be by ourselves?”</p>

<p class='c009'>One jerky question tumbled on to the heels of another.
It was idle for Eric to pretend that nothing had happened;
it was impossible to remain silent.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’ll be only the two of us,” said O’Rane.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s find a taxi.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They had driven half-way to O’Rane’s house in Westminster,
when Eric leaned through the window without
warning and countermanded the order.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The club will be better,” he explained. “We may meet
my agent, Grierson, and I want to have a word with him.
You don’t mind?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not a bit... I think I’d better take charge, Eric.
First of all, have a cigarette. I don’t carry them myself,
I’m afraid. Then don’t try to talk, if you don’t feel like it;
and don’t try to keep up appearances on my account. I’m
blind, to begin with; and I know what you’re going through.
Give me your hand. That’s right... Sorry! I didn’t mean
to hurt you; I suppose I’ve rather a powerful grip. Now,
you’ve to make the hell of a big effort—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve made it,” Eric interrupted unsteadily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re only at the beginning. I take it you gave her
free choice?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I decided for her. I had a moment of revelation
and I jumped at the opportunity. I knew that, if I didn’t
take it then, I should go on struggling until I could never
take it. I cut my own throat. I lied to her and said that
I’d been forbidden even to think of marrying—ever. That
letter was to square Gaisford. She’s upset—on my account;
but she’ll forget it the first time she sees Gaymer. That
brute... And a month ago she was begging me to marry
<span class='pageno' title='294' id='Page_294'></span>her without waiting, because she was so sure of herself.
I’ve taken your advice, Raney, with—interest. I’ve handed
her over without a fight. It’s been a—most valuable experience,—something
to think about when I’m abroad. I
feel there’s a tremendous joke somewhere, only I can’t see
it. Shall we telephone to Gaymer and see if he can help us?
And she’s crying because I’ve been so <em>good</em> to her, she can’t
<em>bear</em> to think I’m ill, I must <em>know</em> she’ll wait till I’m well...
<em>You</em> can see the fun of it, can’t you, Raney? The rollicking
farce? If I died, she’d die too; a perfect sentiment. We’re
just by Buckingham Palace now. I was taking her home
from the opera, and Gaymer passed us in a car—on this spot—with
another woman. Gaymer, who’s going to make her
happy! And she went and bearded him in his own rooms;
and he turned her out!... Just on this spot... That was
the beginning of everything. She’ll tell you that, when she
got home that night, she prayed that she might die....”</p>

<p class='c009'>The taxi swerved to the kerb and stopped with a jerk.
O’Rane relaxed his grip on Eric’s hand and opened the door
to let out the dog.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A big effort!,” he whispered.</p>

<p class='c009'>The lights of the hall and the hum of conversation in the
dining-room steadied Eric, and he discussed the bill of fare
with a show of interest, even stirring himself to nod or wave
a hand to his friends, as they threaded their way among the
tables. Once he remembered that he had done all this before,
two nights ere he said good-bye to Barbara Neave and to
England. It would have been better, if he had never come
back; he never meant to come back, but he had been summoned.
It was not his fault; looking back on the past two
months, could any one say that he was to blame for anything?
Was he to blame for sacrificing himself now? Did
it matter what any one did, so long as Providence punished
folly and wisdom equally? That was where God came in.
<span class='pageno' title='295' id='Page_295'></span>Perhaps that was the secret of this incomparable joke which
he felt without understanding....</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know now why Adam and Eve were turned out of the
Garden of Eden!,” he exclaimed suddenly.</p>

<p class='c009'>O’Rane looked up in surprise.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is this a new riddle?,” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s the oldest riddle in the world. <em>They</em> knew the difference
between good and evil; God never did. I sometimes
wonder why any of us try to lead a decent life or to do the
right thing. It doesn’t pay in this world, and I’m sure God
only despises you in the next... You’d like a glass of
sherry, wouldn’t you?,” he added, as their waiter came
within ear-shot.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hardly ever touch wine, thanks...” O’Rane listened
for a moment to the departing footsteps, then lowered his
voice. “If you feel like that, Eric, you’ve only to go back
and say that you want to be married at once. She’ll do it.
If you told her you were going straight to a sanatorium—for
the rest of your life—, you’ve only to ask her and she’ll
go with you. If you play that card, no one in the world can
beat you. And you know it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a long silence only broken by the drumming of
nervous fingers on the table.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes. I know it,” Eric answered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why don’t you play it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps I don’t much care about the idea of bringing consumptive
children into the world.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’ll wait till you’re cured... Don’t be a humbug,
Eric. You’re going to spoil everything, if you become bitter.
Cynicism is a young man’s substitute for knowledge. We’re
not boys. We can see this dispassionately; you’ve done the
right thing, the only possible thing, the inevitable thing. It
hurts, but I can shew you a way of making it hurt less. At
present you’re seeing nothing but blackness ahead, but, if
<span class='pageno' title='296' id='Page_296'></span>you’ll come for a walk with me after dinner, I’ll put something
in place of all you think you’re losing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall be interested to see you try.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear Eric, I shall succeed! I’ve never doubted in
all my life. Will you put yourself in my hands? We
won’t discuss it now, because I want to hear about your immediate
plans. You’ll be away for two years? Have you
decided when you start and where you’re going?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric had thought only that he was losing this girl whom
he had so unnecessarily allowed himself to love. He did not
want to talk about the islands of the South Pacific, but
O’Rane would not leave him alone. It was unseemly and
brutal, this torrent of questions from a man who was in no
way concerned. O’Rane knew some one who would be only
too pleased to take over the lease of the Ryder Street flat;
he knew some one else who might usefully be employed to
spread the news of his departure through the Press; he
knew men at every stopping-place between Liverpool and
the Marquesas, between Southampton and the Cape, and
letters of introduction were to be had for the asking.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re giving me a wonderful funeral,” said Eric.</p>

<p class='c009'>The words were rudely conceived and rudely spoken. It
was a refinement of cruelty to be whipped with questions,
when his brain was too much numbed to think of anything
but Ivy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hardly a funeral. But you’ve closed one chapter, and I
want you to begin the next. It doesn’t do any good to
curse your luck. When I had this accident to my eyes, I
walked straight out of hospital into my next job. Kind
friends wanted to drive me in cars or to take my arm, but
I had to start on my own <em>some</em> time. There’s such a lot to
be done in life that we’ve no leisure for thinking what fun
it would be to have three hands or a million pounds a
minute. When King David was punished in the person of
his son, he did everything in his power to keep the boy
<span class='pageno' title='297' id='Page_297'></span>alive; when once the boy was dead, he rose up and washed
his face and put off all the signs of mourning and started
on <em>his</em> next job. If you don’t begin to-night, it’ll be harder
to begin to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But there’s not very much I <em>can</em> do to-night,” Eric objected
wearily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I assure you there is. Did you find out whether your
agent was in the club? Well, get hold of him and make your
arrangements. I can’t help there, because I know nothing
about the subject, but you and he must know what you fixed
when you went abroad before. In the meantime I’ll get hold
of my tame journalist. I’m going to say simply that you’re
going abroad immediately for the good of your health; I
shan’t say where or how long for. And the news won’t appear
till the day after to-morrow, so you’ll have time to warn
your people. Then we’ll meet—is half an hour long enough
for you?—, and I shall have a lot for you to do. I’m going
to find out if Gaymer’s at home—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m not going to see <em>him</em>!” Eric broke in.</p>

<p class='c009'>O’Rane looked up, with his head on one side, smiling to
himself:</p>

<p class='c009'>“If I convince you that you can contribute in any way to
that girl’s happiness? Dear man, don’t be absurd! I’m assuming
that you love her. That means that you’ll do everything
you can for her and that you’ll rack your brains to
think of new things. D’you imagine that you’ve done your
utmost for her by clearing out of Gaymer’s way—with the
worst possible grace—and wishing them both joy of the
other? You’re going to help this thing through. You’re
going to set her mind at rest, you’re going to shake hands
with him, you’re going to be the man they can both turn
to... This has to be done with a bit of a gesture, Eric.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Forty minutes later they were walking towards Buckingham
Gate. Eric did not know what he was expected to say
or do, but O’Rane assured him that everything would be
<span class='pageno' title='298' id='Page_298'></span>quite easy, and he was too tired to assert himself. He hoped
faintly that Gaymer would be sober and that they would have
no duel of words as on the occasion of his two other visits to
the flat. Perhaps O’Rane would keep the peace....</p>

<p class='c009'>Gaymer opened the door himself, nodded perfunctorily to
Eric and led the way to his smoking-room. He could not
wholly conceal his surprise at their coming; and he busied
himself unduly with chairs, cigars and offers of drink until
one of his visitors should think fit to explain the purpose of
the meeting. Each waited for his neighbour to speak first;
the last tumbler and cigar were distributed, and there was no
pretext for further delay. When the silence became unbearable,
O’Rane turned enquiringly to Eric.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You were going to make a proposal?,” he began.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No. I came here, because you asked me to. I don’t in
the least know what you want me to say.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wanted you to explain; Gaymer’s in the dark still.
Shall I give him an outline?... Gaymer, you both of you
love Miss Maitland, but you can’t both of you marry her.
I don’t think we need consider rights or claims, because—quite
obviously—neither of you would marry her against her
will—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have every intention of marrying her,” Gaymer interrupted
quietly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not against her will. Lane or I have only to say a word
to her, and she’d marry him. I’m not bluffing, Gaymer;
that’s quite certain. Lane doesn’t want to force her hand,
he wants her to marry the man who’ll make her happiest.
Don’t you want the same? This is the judgement of Solomon,
you know. Do you put yourself before her? If you
do, you don’t care for her, you don’t deserve her; and,
Gaymer, you won’t get her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gaymer kicked his heels on to the edge of a chair and
slid lower into his corner of the sofa:</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='299' id='Page_299'></span>“If she tries to marry Lane or any one else, I can have
her back—in the heel of my fist—within a week.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t agree,” said O’Rane. “There are certain new
factors of which you know nothing. But, if it were all
true, would you try to marry her against her will?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come! That’s better.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But it’s not against her will. <em>She</em> knows that. Simply
looking at <em>her</em> happiness—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You won’t make her very happy in your present state,
Gaymer,” said O’Rane sharply. “It’s more than time for
you to steady down and find some work to do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s my business,” murmured Gaymer unamiably.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, it’s ours, if you want our help. Lane has seen her
this evening; he’s come to the conclusion that she wants to
marry you rather than him. He’s given way in your favour.
It’s not an easy thing to do, it’s not an easy position for her;
she’s torn in two and very unhappy. Lane’s going abroad—for
his health. He’s leaving her on such terms that she can
do what she likes without having any cause to reproach herself;
she can marry you with a good conscience. And you’ve
to shew that you’re worthy of what’s being done for you;
she’s being made over to your care. How long will it take
you to find some work?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gaymer looked uncomprehendingly from one to the other.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know,” he answered stupidly.</p>

<p class='c009'>O’Rane turned to Eric.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have you any money?,” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How much do you want?,” said Eric.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, how much can you spare? You want to make a
success of this, don’t you? If there’s a question of their
wanting money to marry on, capital to start in business, you
know, you could supply it? You must have made a great
deal the last few years; and you wouldn’t like Miss Maitland
to go short. Can I leave the question in your hands?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='300' id='Page_300'></span>Eric felt an insane impulse to laugh, but O’Rane’s face
was serious.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hardly feel—,” he began.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you’re going to do everything in your power to make
it a success! They must have money, and I understand the
judge is rather a screw. By the way, we shall have to put
some pressure on him. He’s got a great opinion of you,
Eric. I met him at dinner the other night, and he was talking
very warmly about you. You will have to do some
propaganda for Gaymer. And then we must find regular
work... Can you manage five hundred a year for a few
years?”</p>

<p class='c009'>As Eric hesitated in bewilderment, Gaymer intervened.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We needn’t discuss this,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you don’t take it, I’ll see that your wife does,” said
O’Rane. “You could manage that, Eric?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I could.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you will?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric felt himself being hypnotized. A voice that was not
under his control answered:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will.”</p>

<p class='c009'>O’Rane stood up and called his dog.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lane has to go abroad for his lungs,” he explained.
“He’ll be all right in a year or two’s time, but he’s told Miss
Maitland that he’ll never be in a condition to marry; you
must back up the story. Now that’s pretty well all. Lane
will be busy the next few days, so you’d better not go near
his place. After that, I understand that Miss Maitland will
have to go away to the country for a bit. When she comes
back, you can see her. If she shews any hesitation, you can
tell her that Lane himself provided the money for you to
marry her on. That’ll fix <em>that</em>... Now we must be
going.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He walked to the door and felt for the handle. Eric
rose wearily and followed him, hardly troubling to wonder
<span class='pageno' title='301' id='Page_301'></span>where he was being taken. Gaymer sat biting his nails and
staring at the floor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-bye,” O’Rane called from the door.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was an inarticulate grunt from the sofa. Eric was
half-way across the room, but he hesitated and came back to
Gaymer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t suppose I shall see you again,” he said. “Good-bye.
Good luck.”</p>

<p class='c009'>O’Rane was humming to himself in the hall. Gaymer
looked towards the door; then his eyes swept slowly round
on a level with Eric’s waist; they raised themselves diffidently,
and he saw a hand stretched out to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-bye, Lane,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you shake hands?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why? We’re not friends. And you’ve not given me
anything.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The humming ceased, and O’Rane called out to know
whether Eric was coming.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m too tired to wrangle,” sighed Eric. “Don’t shake
hands, if you don’t want to. Good-bye again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric’s hand fell to his side, and he walked slowly to the
door and across the hall.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What d’you want me to do now?,” he asked dully.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll take you home,” answered O’Rane. “I’m afraid
Gaymer hasn’t learned the art of being gracious; and he’ll
be punished for it. I’m prepared to bet he’s being punished
now. Whenever he looks at his wife, he’ll remember that
you behaved well and he didn’t. He’ll try to forget it; but
she won’t let him, she’ll always know that, when you found
you couldn’t marry her yourself, you strained every nerve to
get her happily married to the man she loved better than you.
If anything makes Gaymer run straight, it’ll be that reflection.
You’ve behaved uncommonly well, Eric, if I may
say so, though not better than she deserved; you’re giving up
<span class='pageno' title='302' id='Page_302'></span>everything to her, but she was ready to give up everything to
you. I’ve not finished with you yet; you’ve still to give your
blessing to the marriage. Tell her quite simply that, as you
can’t marry her yourself—Yes, you must do that... And
that’s all you <em>can</em> do. If they’re coming to grief, you can’t
stop them; you’ve already done what only one man in ten
million would do. In future—you’re funking the future,
aren’t you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It seems a little—purposeless,” said Eric.</p>

<p class='c009'>He wondered whether his voice trembled as much as his
lips.</p>

<p class='c009'>“One gets moments like that. It’s all due to our literary
conception of beginnings and ends. How long have we
known each other? Fifteen years? D’you remember your
last Phoenix Club dinner with Sinclair as president? Jim
Loring was there; and George Oakleigh; and Jack Waring.
In those days I’d made up my mind to a great career; I was
going to make pots of money and I was going to be the great
democratic leader... Then the war came, just when I’d
made the money and lost it; one was incapacitated to a certain
extent... But, even when I was lying in hospital, I never
said ‘This is the end’... You’re a bit incapacitated, but
this isn’t the end; you’ve just been pulled up by a big obstacle
and you’ve overdone it. I said I’d give you something
in place of all you were losing. Well, haven’t I? You
could have kept that girl, but you’ve done everything—at the
heaviest possible cost—to serve her interests. You’ve that
to be proud of. What are the things one has to overcome before
one can attain greatness of spirit? Greed, fear, selfishness?
You’ve done that. Weakness?... I keep on thinking
of Sinclair’s dinner-party. You know that my wife was
engaged to Jim Loring before she married me; and you and
Jack Waring were both in love with Barbara Neave before
she married George. ’Curious what havoc one or two women
can make in half a dozen men’s lives! It came near to
<span class='pageno' title='303' id='Page_303'></span>beating Jim; I believe it did beat Waring. But are you
going to be beaten and to let your life be spoiled for a
woman? You’re bigger than either of those two; you’ve had
ill-health to contend with all your life and you’ve made a
world-wide reputation for yourself in spite of it. And in
those days Woman for us was a girl of eighteen that we
flirted with on the stairs at a dance... We underestimate
them at first, then we exaggerate them enormously, then we
get them into perspective; but Woman is not a man’s chief
business in his prime. Did you plan a wonderful career for
yourself at that dinner? I told you even then that you were
the genius among us all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Eric looked back with a shudder over the devastation of
fifteen years to his last night as an undergraduate at Oxford.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose I did... Yes, it was a solemn moment, just
when we were going down. I dreamed that one day I
should have the whole world at my feet. People would
whisper who I was when I came into a room... I suppose
I’ve got that. But it’s so small. I’m genuinely surprised
when I find that any one’s heard of me. I’m terrified when
people come up and congratulate me on my plays... If
that’s fame... I think it was when I found how unsatisfying
it was that I began to yearn for something more...
You haven’t told me how I’m going to keep myself amused
for the next two years, Raney. I shall be allowed to do very
little work.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You won’t be amused. But you may be consoled to think
that your soul’s been in danger and that you’ve saved it by
sacrifice. It was touch-and-go whether you spoiled that
girl’s life.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And I’ve given her life to Gaymer to spoil.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If he must. But you’ve set him an example that he
won’t easily forget. I still believe in sudden conversions;
and I expect to find him a different man from to-night. You
<span class='pageno' title='304' id='Page_304'></span>must give time for the lesson to sink in; he’s dazed at present—like
you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Loathing of Gaymer was a feeling which Eric could not
yet repress; he brought his stick with a crash on to the pavement.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not he! You talked about a ‘gesture,’ and he knows
it’s that and nothing more. I’ve given her up because I
couldn’t keep her... I don’t complain. She had her
choice of us, and the better man won.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was the better man who made the gesture,” said O’Rane
quietly. “Is this the house? I don’t think I can do any
good by coming in. Make her see that you’re still her devoted
friend and that love has no necessary connection with
marriage. You told me you were going to your people to-morrow?
You’ll find that devilish hard, but you mustn’t
stand any sympathy from them, or you’ll begin to pity yourself.
Come and see me, as soon as you’re back in London.
I’ll organize a farewell dinner for you. A bit ironical after
your send-off in New York? I thought I’d discount it by
saying it first... Remember you have to go through this
with your head up. Good-night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He held out his hand, and Eric gripped it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-night and thank you. Can you get home all right?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m not going home. I’m going to do some propaganda
with this girl’s father.”</p>

<p class='c009'>O’Rane turned with a wave of his hand, slipped his fingers
through the dog’s collar and strode towards St. James’
Street. Eric watched him melting from sight and then
walked upstairs. He tried to make a picturesque comparison
between his own disappearance into the solitude of California
and O’Rane’s eternal solitude of blindness; he wondered why
any one troubled to advise and guide him, why he so tamely
submitted. What was the sum of all this counsel?... He
was inexpressibly tired. And it was ironical that he should
<span class='pageno' title='305' id='Page_305'></span>be spending another night so close to Ivy when he had renounced
her.</p>

<p class='c009'>The light was burning in her room, and after some hesitation
he put his head in at the door. She seemed to be sleeping,
but awoke as he looked at her and cried out to know
where he had been.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was dining with O’Rane,” he said. “I went away, Ivy,
because I couldn’t bear to see you crying. And I was a bit
unnerved myself. It’s done me good, talking to him. He’s
so extraordinarily plucky himself and he’s never in any kind
of doubt. He’s cleared my mind of doubt. If I could
marry you without doing you a wrong, there’s nothing I
wouldn’t do to bring it about. You know that, don’t you?
I love you more than any one in the world, you’ll always be
my own child, and nothing can take away my right to love
you and try to protect you. But we can’t marry; so we
mustn’t upset each other by thinking about it. I’m going
away to try and get cured, and you must get well yourself
and make your own life just as though we’d never thought
of marrying. You remember that I made a will some weeks
ago? I’m arranging for certain money to be paid you—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Eric!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes. That’ll make you independent. I want to see you
happily married. You told me that, if I were dead or if
we’d never met, you’d probably marry John Gaymer. I want
you to pretend that we’ve never met. I hate to think of
giving any one else the right to take care of you, but I can’t
do it from the other side of the Atlantic... You’ve been
a wonderful thing in my life, a little fairy that walked in out
of the street... I shall expect to hear everything that you
do and how you’re getting on. I’m going to get quite well,
but a man with weak lungs has no business to marry. And
that’s the long and the short of it. I’m going down to-morrow
to tell my people... If ever you need help, Ivy,
you can call on me; I’ll come back from California, if I can
<span class='pageno' title='306' id='Page_306'></span>do anything for you. Now I mustn’t keep you awake, or
I shall get into trouble with Gaisford. Promise me you
won’t worry. Promise me you won’t make yourself
miserable... Darling Ivy, you mustn’t cry again; I’m losing
more than you are. Don’t try to talk. Just kiss me
good-night. May God bless you, Ivy, and make you very
happy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As he untwined her arms and turned out the light, he
could hear the sobs breaking out afresh. They followed him
across the hall into his bedroom. Nearly three years earlier,
when he had said good-bye to Barbara, he had returned home
to find the telephone ringing in every room and he had
muffled the bells and thrown himself half-undressed on his
bed, blind and mad with pain. For two years he had wondered
what would have happened, if he had yielded to
temptation and spoken to her....</p>

<p class='c009'>The sobbing of a heart-broken child pursued him, though
he shut his door and buried his head in the pillows. O’Rane
was convinced that he had only to make his appeal, to trade
on his own health and beg her to come with him....</p>

<p class='c009'>If she dreaded the appeal, why did she go on crying?</p>

<p class='c009'>He tried to think of next day’s meeting with his mother.
“No danger... I assure you there’s nothing to worry
about! Ask Gaisford, if you don’t believe me...” And
then, as in a careless postscript: “Of course, there can be no
question of marrying. Just as well we found out in time,
wasn’t it?” Would his mother be deceived? He would
have to tell her in that quiet, confidential hour when his
father had gone to bed; he would surely tell her in his
father’s drowsy, smoke-laden work-room where he had already
boasted—prematurely enough to set God scheming
against him—that he would make an effort to win, that he
<em>would</em> win, that he had won....</p>

<p class='c009'>If indeed he had won, it was a secret victory; and Raney
alone knew whom he had met and overcome....</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='307' id='Page_307'></span>The sobbing still haunted him. If Ivy dreaded the appeal,
how <em>could</em> she go on crying?</p>

<p class='c009'>He threw aside the pillows and walked uncertainly to the
door. His fingers went to the handle and drew back without
touching it, went forward again, tried and turned. The
door opened, and he could hear muffled sobbing, no longer
imaginary. He walked on tip-toe half-way across the hall,
then returned and stood listening in the open door-way.
Then he closed the door and locked it.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sobbing grew fainter and died away.</p>

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
